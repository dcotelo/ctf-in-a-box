// One customer-managed key for every SecureString this event uses.
//
// WHY NOT THE DEFAULT `alias/aws/ssm` KEY: the execution role needs
// `kms:Decrypt` to read its SecureStrings, and the AWS-managed SSM key cannot
// be named as a policy resource in a way that scopes to this event — it is
// shared by every Parameter Store SecureString in the account. Granting
// `kms:Decrypt` on `"*"` (even conditioned on `kms:ViaService`) therefore lets
// this role decrypt any parameter in the account whose key delegates access to
// IAM, which is every SecureString anybody else stored under the default key.
// A dedicated key makes the grant in iam.tf name exactly one resource.
//
// THE OPERATOR MUST USE THIS KEY for the secrets they create by hand. The
// module writes the two parameters it generates itself (elasticache.tf), but
// BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, SRH_TOKEN and GITHUB_TOKEN are
// `aws ssm put-parameter` calls an operator makes — and a parameter encrypted
// under a different key cannot be decrypted by the scoped grant, so the task
// fails to start with an `AccessDeniedException` on the KMS key rather than
// anything that names the real problem. `outputs.tf` prints the `--key-id`
// argument as part of those instructions for exactly this reason.
