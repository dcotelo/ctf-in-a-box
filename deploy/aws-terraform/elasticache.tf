// Managed Redis, replacing the compose stack's `redis:8-alpine` container and
// its AOF volume.
//
// IN-TRANSIT ENCRYPTION IS ON, and that is a checked decision rather than a
// default. srh — the Upstash-REST shim every service talks to — turns TLS on by
// detecting the `rediss://` scheme on its connection string, and verifies the
// hostname while doing it (`lib/srh/redis/client_worker.ex`):
//
//     enable_ssl = String.starts_with?(connection_string, "rediss://")
//     socket_opts = [customize_hostname_check: [
//       match_fun: :public_key.pkix_verify_hostname_match_fun(:https)]]
//     Redix.start_link(connection_string, ssl: enable_ssl, socket_opts: socket_opts)
//
// Two consequences this module has to honour, and does:
//   1. srh must be handed the ElastiCache PRIMARY ENDPOINT HOSTNAME, never an
//      address — hostname verification is on, and a certificate does not match
//      an IP. See `local.redis_url` in ecs.tf.
//   2. AUTH rides in the URI userinfo, parsed by Redix rather than by srh.
//
// DURABILITY is snapshots, not the AOF-on-a-volume the EC2 box had. That is a
// real change in kind: a restore is coarser-grained and to a daily boundary.
// The event archive (export/import on the admin Event tab) is the
// content-level backup and the one an organizer should rely on before anything
// risky; these snapshots are the floor under a node failure.
