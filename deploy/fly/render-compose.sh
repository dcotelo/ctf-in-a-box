# Render docker-compose.yml into the compose file Fly deploys.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS A RENDER RATHER THAN A SECOND FILE.
#
# Fly can deploy a compose file directly (`[build.compose]` in fly.toml), which
# is what lets the hosted event run the SAME services, in the same wiring, as
# `docker compose up` — one source of truth, no hand-maintained cloud twin to
# drift from the real stack.
#
# But flyctl's compose parser is not Docker's. It is a hand-rolled yaml.v3
# unmarshal (`internal/containerconfig/compose.go`), and as of flyctl 0.4.87 it
# does NOT implement:
#
#   * `profiles:`            — every service in the file is deployed
#   * `${VAR}` interpolation — `${SRH_TOKEN}` arrives as that literal string
#   * build `args:`          — irrelevant here anyway: Fly builds nothing (see
#                              deploy.sh's step 2/5), so no image is ever
#                              built through this path
#
# and it rejects a file where more than one service declares `build:`
# ("only one service can specify build"), which docker-compose.yml does twice.
#
# `docker compose config` implements all three, correctly, because it is
# Docker's own parser. So the real compose file goes through Docker first and
# Fly receives the result. Everything Fly cannot do is therefore done by the
# tool that defines the format, not reimplemented here.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT ADDS on top of `docker compose config`:
#
#   1. NOTHING. Specifically: secret values are LEFT IN, and this file is
#      therefore a credential file — mode 600, gitignored, and deleted by
#      deploy.sh once the deploy succeeds.
#
#      It was built the other way first: values stripped, `fly secrets` relied
#      on, because Fly's documentation says secrets are "global and available
#      to every container". They are not. A machine's containers receive only
#      their own `ExtraEnv`, which comes from this file's `environment:` block;
#      the machine config carries no `secrets` key at all. Every container came
#      up without its credentials while `fly secrets list` showed all fourteen
#      as `Deployed` — the app answering 500 from better-auth's default-secret
#      error, the scorer refusing to start, and sync refusing to poll with no
#      org or token to poll with.
#
#      The compensation is real, though: per-service scoping that Fly's global
#      secrets cannot express. The app never receives REDIS_PASSWORD, and redis
#      never receives GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET.
#   2. `build:` becomes `image:`. Images are built and pushed beforehand, so
#      Fly builds nothing — and the images the event runs are the exact ones
#      built from this checkout.
#   3. Service hostnames become localhost. Containers in one Fly machine share
#      a network namespace; there is no DNS between them, and `srh` resolves
#      nowhere. This is also what makes the deployment work at all: srh's Redis
#      client is IPv4-only and Fly's private network is IPv6-only, so reaching
#      redis over loopback is the only arrangement srh can connect through.
#   4. Host bind mounts are dropped. A Fly machine has no repo checkout to bind
#      FROM. Nothing among app, scorer, sync, srh or redis declares one — the
#      only bind mount in docker-compose.yml belongs to caddy, which SERVICES
#      already excludes (Fly terminates TLS itself; see below).
#   5. Named volumes and networks are dropped. Fly ignores both; volumes are
#      declared as `[[mounts]]` in fly.toml, and a single machine has no
#      networks to join.

Renders docker-compose.yml to a Fly-deployable compose file.

Without --profiles/--services, both are derived from ENV_FILE together:
`app srh redis` and `--profile app` always, plus `scorer sync` and
`--profile secdev` iff SCORE_IMAGE is non-empty there. Fly's own deploy.sh
always requires SCORE_IMAGE (it has no other route to a scorer), so in
practice this always renders secdev too — the derivation lives here so a
future relaxation of that requirement is a one-line change.

THE OUTPUT IS A CREDENTIAL FILE: mode 600, and refused unless gitignored.
Per-container `environment:` is the only channel that reaches a container in a
Fly machine — `fly secrets` does not, whatever the documentation says — so the
values have to travel in it. deploy.sh removes it once the deploy succeeds.

# which resolves nowhere in a shared network namespace. That is the original
# bug this whole module exists to fix, reintroduced by the renderer, and it
# would have looked exactly like it did before: srh healthy, unable to connect.
