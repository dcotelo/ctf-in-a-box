# Stand the kit up on fly.io: ONE app, ONE machine, every container in it.
#
# The machine runs the same five services docker-compose.yml defines — app,
# scorer, sync, srh, redis — from a compose file rendered out of that very
# file, so the deployed wiring cannot drift from the local one. See fly.toml
# for why it is one app rather than five (short version: srh's Redis client is
# IPv4-only and Fly's private network is IPv6-only, so the containers have to
# share a network namespace and talk over localhost).
#
# Idempotent by design, like ctf-setup.sh: every step checks before it acts, so
# re-running after a failure resumes rather than duplicating. Secrets are set
# through `fly secrets`, never written into a file.

  init --refresh
          Re-copy the values that must match an EXTERNAL system (GitHub
          OAuth, the sync App, the scorer image, the fork org and its admin
          allowlist) from --from into the env file, overwriting what is
          there, then tops up anything still missing (SRH_TOKEN, the region,
          REDIS_PASSWORD, the single-volume knobs) exactly as a plain init
          would. Run this after rotating anything. Fly-specific values
          (EVENT_URL, FLY_REGION, SRH_TOKEN, REDIS_PASSWORD) are left alone
          — they belong to this deployment.

  init    Prepare an env file for Fly: copies --from (default .env), rewrites
          EVENT_URL to the app's Fly hostname, and fills in SRH_TOKEN and
          REDIS_PASSWORD if they are absent. Touches nothing on Fly and needs
          no CLI. Asks which Fly region to run in, or takes --region. Safe to
          re-run — it tops up an existing file rather than overwriting it, and
          tightens it to mode 600.

  (none)  Deploy: build and push the app and sync images, mirror the scorer
          image, render the compose file, set secrets, deploy the machine.

          The region comes from FLY_REGION in the env file (init asks), and
          drives both volumes and `fly deploy --primary-region`.

          It also WARNS — never refuses — when the env file's external
          credentials disagree with --from (default .env): the keys that
          differ are named, values never printed. That is the check that
          would have caught a re-created org's .env.fly going unrefreshed.

--skip-build reuses the images already in Fly's registry. Use it when only a
  secret or a runtime setting changed — it turns a multi-minute rebuild into
  a redeploy. NOT safe after changing SCORE_IMAGE: the mirror step is skipped
  too, so the machine keeps the scorer image already in the registry.
--dry-run prints every fly command it would run and makes NONE of them.
  Secret VALUES are redacted from that output.

# rebuilt-and-repushed `:scorer` therefore did NOT reach a running machine: the
# registry held the new image, the machine kept serving the old one, and the
# only symptom was a 404 on a route the new build has and the old one does not.
# Nothing in the deploy output was wrong, which is what made it expensive.
#
# Resolving here means the rendered compose names the exact artifact that was
# just pushed, so what runs is what was built. It matches how docker-compose.yml
# already pins srh, and it makes a deploy reproducible: the same file redeployed
# later brings up the same bytes rather than whatever the tag points at then.
#
# Falls back to the tag if resolution fails (an old buildx without --format).
# A deploy that still works on a tag beats a deploy that refuses to run.

# The flip side is that scoping is impossible — the app container also
# receives REDIS_PASSWORD, and the redis container also receives
# GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET. That is a Fly platform limit, not a choice here, and
# it is recorded in ADR 42 alongside the loss of the frontend/backend split.
#
# NOTE: no `--stage`. `--stage` means "hold these, apply on the next deploy",
# and on a real run it left six secrets permanently staged — better-auth with
# no baseURL and no signing secret answers 403 to /api/auth/sign-in/social, so
# sign-in was broken with nothing in the app's own logs to explain it.
# `--detach` keeps it from blocking on the machine restart, since the deploy
# that follows waits anyway.

  Deployed. Finish these by hand:

  1. OAuth callback must match the deployed host exactly:
       $EVENT_URL/api/auth/callback/github
     Update it at https://github.com/settings/developers if it still points
     somewhere else. Sign-in fails with a redirect_uri mismatch otherwise.

  2. Confirm every container came up, and that srh reached redis:
       fly logs --app $APP
       fly ssh console --app $APP -C "redis-cli PING"

  3. Open $EVENT_URL, sign in, and check /admin loads for a login listed in
     ADMIN_LOGINS in $ENV_FILE. A 403 there almost always means that login is
     missing (or misspelled — logins join case-insensitively, but the list
     itself must still contain it) — fix $ENV_FILE and redeploy.

  Custom domain instead of *.fly.dev:
       fly certs add <domain> --app $APP
     then set EVENT_URL to it, update the OAuth callback, and redeploy
     (BETTER_AUTH_URL is a secret, and the cookie's Secure flag follows it).
