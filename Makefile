# Thin wrappers around the commands in AGENTS.md — that file is the
# authority on what CI runs; this just saves retyping the `cd`s. Pick the
# area you touched. There is deliberately no full-repo `test` target: CI's
# `changes` job path-filters per area, and one target that runs everything
# would undo that discipline locally.
