# Structural + behavioural invariants for the per-target bring-ups
# (`scorer/entrypoints/*.sh`).
#
# These are the cheap guard rails around one expensive fact: `scripts/
# acceptance-target.sh <target> none` and the stock-scores-zero matrix prove the
# source path end to end, but that costs minutes of Maven and image builds per
# target. The tests here run in under a second and fail loudly if a later edit
# quietly removes the path, so nobody has to notice it in a 40-minute CI matrix.
#
# The bring-ups are POSIX-sh FRAGMENTS sourced by entrypoint.sh, which supplies
# NETWORK / APP_HOST / APP_URL / APP_CONTAINER / APP_IMAGE and reads BOOTED back
# out. The behavioural tests below reproduce that contract with a stubbed
# `docker` (and `node`) on PATH, so they exercise real branch selection without a
# Docker daemon, a network, or a single byte pulled.
