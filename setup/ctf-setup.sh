# Subcommands (run with NO subcommand, or `wizard`, for the guided setup):
#   wizard    DEFAULT — step-by-step zero-to-scored: inspects state and only
#             prompts for what's missing. Asks for each value inline (the
#             bootstrap keys GITHUB_ORG / ADMIN_LOGINS / SCORE_IMAGE, EVENT_URL,
#             App/OAuth credentials) with instructions + URLs,
#             writing them as you go — no editing files by hand between steps.
#             Guides + verifies each UI-only step. Resumable (safe to re-run).

#             + print install steps, mirror scorer image
#             (idempotent/re-runnable: every step is skipped once its
#             target state is already satisfied, so re-running `org` after
#             a partial run or failure just resumes where it left off)
#   render    (re)render just the per-target scoring workflows into dist/workflows/
#   upgrade   re-commit the rendered scoring workflow to every fork whose
#             committed copy is behind the template's
#             `# ctf-workflow-version:` stamp — how a fix to ctf-score.yml
#             reaches an event that is ALREADY provisioned (`org` does this
#             too, but also re-mirrors the scorer image)
#   teardown  archive event repos after the event
#   doctor    read-only status check: verify a previously-provisioned org
#             matches targets.tsv (no mutation, no --dry-run needed)
#   app-manifest  open a self-submitting form to create the sync GitHub App
#                 from sync/app-manifest.json against the event org (removes
#                 the manual JSON copy-paste; you still click Create/Install)
#   app-config    ingest a downloaded App private key (.pem) + App ID into
#                 .env (--app-id N --pem path [--installation-id N])
#   oauth-app     open GitHub's new-OAuth-App page for the event org and print
#                 the exact field values (signin auth; UI-only, no auto-fill)
#   oauth-config  write the OAuth client id + secret into .env (--client-id ID;
#                 the secret is read from a hidden prompt, never on argv)
#
# Every setting this script reads comes from the env file (.env by default,
# --out elsewhere): GITHUB_ORG names the event org, ADMIN_LOGINS says who may
# open /admin, and SCORE_IMAGE being NON-EMPTY is how a box says "this event
