# VulnerableApp bring-up. Sourced by entrypoint.sh.

# A single Spring Boot container serving on 9090 with no external dependencies.
# The generic boot would work, except the rubric's tests read VULNERABLEAPP_URL
# in addition to APP_URL, and the app needs its startup grace period before the
# first challenge child spawns — 110 children at concurrency 8 would otherwise
# all race an unready app and trip the unreachable early-abort.
