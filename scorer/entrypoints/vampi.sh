# VAmPI bring-up. Sourced by entrypoint.sh.
#
# VAmPI is a single Flask container with a self-contained SQLite database; the
# rubric's own createDb() helper seeds it over HTTP, so there is no database
# sibling to start. The only thing this adds over the generic path is the
# vulnerable-mode env var — VAmPI ships a hardened mode, and scoring a hardened
# instance would pass every probe against an unpatched fork.
