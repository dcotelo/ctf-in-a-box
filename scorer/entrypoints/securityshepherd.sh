# scorer/entrypoints/securityshepherd.sh
# Security Shepherd bring-up. Sourced by entrypoint.sh.
#
# The heaviest of the six targets, and the only one with no prebuilt stock image:
# `owaspsecurityshepherd/shepherd` does not exist, and the one published image
# (`owasp/security-shepherd`) was last pushed in 2018, years before the release-17
# tree this rubric targets. So there is nothing to pull — the app is BUILT here, from
# a Maven prebuild feeding a THREE-container stack (Tomcat + MariaDB + MongoDB) over
# TLS. Distilled from the upstream reference bring-up
# (.github/actions/ctf-score/entrypoints/score-securityshepherd-challenges.sh).
#
# WHY the source goes through a named VOLUME: the source lands inside THIS container's
# filesystem, but the Maven and image builds run as SIBLING containers on the host
# daemon — a sibling's `-v <path>` mount resolves against the HOST, not against us, so
# it would see nothing. A named volume is the one handoff both sides can reach.
#
# WHY the internet-less $NETWORK is not a problem for the build: only the three app
# containers join $NETWORK (step 4). The Maven and image builds (steps 2-3) run with no
# --network at all, so they land on the daemon's default bridge, which has internet.
#
# CONTAINER NAMES are load-bearing. The WAR bakes jdbc:mariadb://secshep_mariadb:3306
# and connectionHost=secshep_mongo, and the vendored helpers.js `docker exec`s those
# exact names to provision the shared attacker account. So the siblings MUST be
# secshep_mariadb / secshep_mongo / secshep_tomcat. Tomcat ALSO takes the $APP_HOST
# network alias, because it rejects an underscore host ("secshep_tomcat") with HTTP 400
# and $APP_URL has to resolve to something it will serve.
#
# TLS: the bundled self-signed certificate expired in 2019, so chain verification can
# never succeed. Do NOT terminate TLS or re-issue the cert — the rubric's helpers
# disable verification deliberately and several tests assert on TLS-level behaviour.
# NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED is exported instead, so the judge's own waitForApp probe
# (and every exec child it spawns) accepts it too.

# APP_IMAGE is deliberately UNUSED here, and it is the only bring-up that ignores it: the
# three images are one unit — the WAR, the MariaDB schema and the Mongo seed are all
# outputs of the same Maven run — so a prebuilt Tomcat image paired with freshly built
# siblings would boot against a schema it was never compiled for. Source is the only
# coherent input. `scripts/acceptance-target.sh securityshepherd none` passes an empty
# APP_IMAGE to say exactly that.

# 2) Maven build. Not optional and not a caching nicety: all three Dockerfiles `COPY

#    Maven 3.9) to match the tree's <release>17</release>, independent of the runner.
#    Output is buffered and replayed only on failure: a green build is ~1500 lines of
#    dependency downloads that bury the scoring log, and the tail on failure is what an
#    organizer actually needs.

# 3) Build the three images from the volume, in a docker-CLI sibling that holds BOTH the

#    different Maven artifact) and are mostly I/O, so they run concurrently. Each build's
#    output is buffered and replayed only on failure — three interleaved build logs are
#    unreadable, and a green run does not need them.

# The readiness signal is a SUCCESSFUL ADMIN LOGIN, not a 200 from /login.jsp: Tomcat

# test files calls loginShepherd() at TOP LEVEL, before registering a single test — so an
# app whose DB is not up yet produces 40 children that throw before any assertion runs,
# reporting neither ✔ nor ✖. That scores a clean-looking 0/40 with nothing actually
# tested: the vacuous zero this handshake exists to rule out.
#
# The bootstrap itself: stock admin ships with the TEMP password "password", forced to
# reset on first login, while the rubric logs in as admin/SecurityShepherd. So POST /login
# with the temp password to pick up the CSRF token cookie, then POST /passwordChange. The
# whole sequence is retried, because an early failure usually just means the DB is still
# seeding.
