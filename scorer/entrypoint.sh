# ctf scorer — judge entrypoint (score-action contract).

# Runs inside the scorer image with docker.sock mounted. Boots the app under
# test as a SIBLING container on the internal ctf network, then runs the
# declarative rubric probes against it and writes $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/ctf-score.md.
#
# Env in (from score-action / the consumer workflow):
#   TARGET             rubric target id (required) — names the app container
#   APP_URL            where the app answers, ON the ctf network (required)
#   APP_IMAGE          optional prebuilt app image to pull + run
#   NETWORK            ctf docker network (default ctfnet)
#   GITHUB_WORKSPACE   PR checkout (holds the PR's Dockerfile for the patch path)
#   GITHUB_EVENT_PATH  webhook payload (author/pr/sha)
#   SCORE_API/SCORE_TOKEN  optional leaderboard push (engine skips POST if unset)
