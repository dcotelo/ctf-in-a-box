// Both scoring bugs this event hit had the identical shape: the poller
// consumed a comment, submitted nothing, and said nothing. The `continue`
// that dropped the score sat above every logged branch, so the failure was
// invisible by construction — the leaderboard was simply missing points that
// the PR itself displayed correctly.
//
// These tests pin the counters and the log lines that make that shape
// audible. They are deliberately written against `tick` rather than a helper:
// what matters is not that a counter function increments, but that the real
// ingest loop reaches it on each of its silent paths.
