 * Reads the cursor/seen-cache state file, repairing anything unusable.
 *
 * The file is JSON this service wrote, so it is tempting to trust its SHAPE
 * once it parses. That was the bug (#63): a partial write, a disk problem or a
 * hand edit during a reset can leave behind valid JSON that is still wrong,
 * and `{}` parses perfectly. The old `catch` only covered read and parse
 * errors, so a bare `{}` sailed through and `repoState` then dereferenced an
 * absent `repos` — on every repo, on every tick.
 *
 * That throw is not contained anywhere: `tick`'s per-repo `try` wraps only the
 * fetch, so the rejection reaches main's fatal handler and exits 1, compose
 * restarts the container, and it reads the same file again. Ingestion stays
 * down for the whole event, which is why this repairs rather than propagates.
 *
 * Repairing is not the same as discarding. Anything still usable is kept —
 * re-zeroing `ingested` would misreport the event's totals, and dropping
 * `resetAt` would make the next tick re-apply a master reset it already
 * performed. Only what is actually broken is replaced.
 *
 * A MISSING file is not a fault: that is every event's first boot, and warning
 * about it would cry wolf. Anything else that had to be repaired is logged,
 * because a silent repair is how a corrupt state file goes unnoticed until the
 * cursor quietly re-reads from scratch.

/** The dedupe key for one comment REVISION: its id AND the moment it last

 *
 *  Keying on the id alone silently lost scores. The scoring workflow UPSERTS
 *  one comment per target — it posts "⏳ Scoring in progress…", then edits
 *  that same comment with the result — so a PR whose first run does not
 *  produce a score (a transient failure, a missing package grant, an
 *  infrastructure break) burns its id on the placeholder. The re-run then
 *  edits the SAME comment id with the real score, `markSeen` reports it as
 *  already handled, and the poller skips it and advances its cursor past it.
 *  Forever, and without a log line: the caller `continue`s before it reaches
 *  any of the logged branches.
 *
 *  Observed exactly that way on a live event: DVWA comment 5364196433 was
 *  created 01:47 reading "Scoring did not complete", updated 02:06 carrying a
 *  real `ctf-score:` marker, and never ingested — the contestant's PR showed
 *  a correct score while the leaderboard showed nothing.
 *
 *  Re-ingesting is safe, which is what makes this the right fix rather than a
 *  risk: `recordSolves` is monotonic (see the scorer's "replaying a solve
 *  changes neither points nor lastSolveAt" test), so the worst case of a key
 *  that changes without the payload changing is one redundant, inert POST. */
