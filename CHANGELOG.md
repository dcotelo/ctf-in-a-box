# Changelog

Releases are repo-level annotated tags cut from `main`
([SemVer](https://semver.org/)); GitHub Releases carry the generated
commit-level notes, and this file keeps the human summary. The version is
repo-level — `apps/web/package.json` tracks the current tag; `scorer` and
`sync` deliberately carry no version field.

## Unreleased

- Classic CTF grew a tile-grid board with per-challenge pages (#208) and
  paid hints through the same gate and penalty fold as secure-development
  (#190).
- Admin activity log: login timestamps plus a filterable event stream on a
  new Activity tab (#213).
- A contestant-facing copy/UX truth pass (#200 tiers 1–4): honest claims,
  state-aware affordances, every module accounted for on the leaderboard
  and profile.
- Audit fixes: quiz freeze reads fail open like classic (#215), hint
  penalties and roster rows match case-insensitively (#216), signing out of
  a session-gated page redirects home (#214).
- Documentation overhaul: README rewritten (status above the fold, fair
  comparison, working no-GitHub quickstart), stale-doc drift fixed across
  the set, ADR/section anchors made renderer-stable, new troubleshooting
  runbook and glossary, OWASP branding removed from the neutral defaults
  (the bare-build event name is now "CTF-in-a-box").

## v0.3.0 — 2026-08-23

Three modules, runtime admin controls, zero vacuous passes.

- **Quiz** and **Classic CTF** shipped as full modules — authored from
  `/admin` (single and bulk JSON-bundle authoring), graded in the app,
  each able to run an event alone with no scorer or GitHub org.
- The admin panel became the runtime control plane: grant/revoke admins,
  switch modules on and off mid-event, set the team cap, scoring cooldown,
  scheduled scoring and registration windows, per-module titles — all
  without a rebuild. Support actions (reset/delete a contestant, take over
  a team) and engagement metrics (Insights) landed alongside.
- Teams: required to score, one-click solo play, shareable `/join/<code>`
  links.
- Security hardening: Redis authenticated and cut off from the app tier,
  same-origin assertions on mutating routes, rate limits on join/reveal,
  HTTPS enforced for production events.
- The vacuous-pass war: a sweep that points every rubric at an
  up-but-useless stub reached **0 of 321** and became a CI gate.
- Deploys: the whole stack as one Fly machine running the repo's own
  compose file; workflow version-stamping with a per-fork `upgrade` path;
  `doctor` verifies the package Read grant by observation.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-08-16

Guided wizard, AWS deploy, verifying doctor.

- `ctf-setup.sh` became a resumable guided wizard that prompts for every
  value inline and does each automatable step.
- Single-shot AWS deploy: a Terraform module for one ephemeral EC2 box.
- `doctor` grew into the per-fork provisioning status matrix.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-08-15

First tagged release: the full offline-tested kit — compose stack, poll
pipeline, six vendored target rubrics.

- **Security (critical):** closed the score-comment forge — the scoring
  workflow could be made to post a contestant's own forged
  `<!-- ctf-score: -->` marker as `github-actions[bot]`. The judge's report
  now lives outside the PR checkout (`CTF_OUT_DIR`) and is posted only when
  the scorer step succeeded.
- Hardening: baseline security headers in both Caddyfiles; the srh proxy
  image pinned by digest.
