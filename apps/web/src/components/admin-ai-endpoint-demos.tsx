// A worked request and response for each of the three module-wide AI
// endpoints, next to the URLs themselves.
//
// The per-challenge panel has always carried a ready-to-run curl for ONE
// route (`/api/ai/event`, signed with that challenge's real key). The other
// two were a URL and nothing else: an organizer could copy `/api/ai/submit`
// and still not know whether it wanted a header, what came back, or what a
// wrong flag looks like next to a refusal. These demos answer send / receive
// / expect for all three, in the shapes docs/ai-module.md §4–§8 specify.
//
// Every value here is a placeholder — `aik_…` for a key, `eyJ…` for a token.
// A challenge's REAL signing key stays on its own row, masked behind Reveal,
// and the one-click dry run stays Send test. These are for reading and
// adapting, which is why the Event demo computes its own signature rather
// than shipping a pre-signed one that would already be expired.
