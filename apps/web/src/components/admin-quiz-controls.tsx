// The Quiz module's admin section: the two retry-gate settings (max attempts,
// retry cooldown) plus full question authoring (add/edit/reorder/delete),
// rendered in place of admin-controls.tsx's old "No settings for this module
// yet." placeholder for the quiz module.
//
// Settings: the numeric inputs reuse `commitNumber` from admin-controls.tsx
// (passed down as a prop, already bound to that component's `settings`/`apply`
// state) — same pattern as the Secure Development hint knobs, not a second
// copy of the same plumbing.
//
// Questions: this component owns its own fetch of GET /api/admin/quiz and its
// own add/edit/reorder/delete state, independent of the settings machinery
// above. `initialQuestions` seeds the list synchronously (used by tests, which
// render with `renderToStaticMarkup` and so never run the mount-time fetch
// below); in the browser it's just the pre-hydration paint, immediately
// replaced by a fresh fetch.
//
// Two authoring fields an organizer used to have to type are now derived, and
// both for the same reason: they were storage plumbing wearing a text input.
//
//   - The question ID is generated from the prompt (`generateQuestionId`, in
//     quiz-keys.ts) when a NEW question is saved. It is the field name in
//     `ctf:quiz:questions` and `ctf:quiz:key` AND the reference every
//     contestant's `ctf:quiz:answers:<login>` row is recorded against, so on an
//     EXISTING question it is immutable: changing it would orphan every answer
//     already banked against the old one, leaving the points on the
//     leaderboard with no question to explain them. That immutability is
//     structural here, not a disabled input: `QuestionDraft` — the thing the
//     form edits — has NO id field at all. The id lives on `QuestionEditor`,
//     which the form never writes to, so `onChange({ ...draft, id })` is not
//     something a future edit to `QuestionForm` can even type.
//   - The ORDER is written from list position. Organizers drag rows (or use
//     the per-row Move up/Move down buttons, which is the keyboard-operable
//     path — drag alone is not operable for everyone, and this is an
//     organizer's control surface). `reorderQuestions` recomputes `order` from
//     the resulting positions and the changed rows are POSTed back. Storage is
//     unchanged: `listQuestions` still sorts by `order`.
//
// Secrecy: this component DOES hold the answer key, and that is deliberate.
// `GET /api/admin/quiz` is behind `requireAdmin` and returns
// `listQuestionsForAdmin()`'s output — one `AdminQuestion` (`{ question,
// correct }`) per question — so opening an existing question for editing
// prefills the choices currently marked correct. The alternative, which this
// component used to implement, was worse than the leak it avoided: an
// organizer fixing a typo in a prompt had to re-pick the answer from memory,
// and getting it wrong silently redefined what counts as correct for every
// contestant, with no diff and no warning. Anyone through the admin gate can
// already delete the question or rewrite its answer outright, so withholding
// the key here bought nothing.
//
// What has NOT changed: the contestant path is keyless, absolutely. `/quiz`
// calls `listQuestions()`, which never reads `ctf:quiz:key`, and builds its
// view model field by field from the public `Question` shape. `AdminQuestion`
// is deliberately NOT assignable to `Question` (see quiz-store.ts), so a
// record from this component cannot be handed to a contestant-facing
// component by mistake — it's a compile error, not a code-review catch.
//
// Deletion changes live event data mid-flight — the question disappears
// from every contestant's board and can no longer be answered — so it is
// gated behind the same `ConfirmModal` + `requireType` pattern the master
// reset uses: Confirm stays disabled until the organizer types the
// question's own PROMPT (see `questionDeleteConfirm`).
//
// What deletion does NOT do: it does not clear contestant history. Points
// already banked for the question stay on the leaderboard, because
// `deleteQuestion` removes only the question and its answer key (see its
// doc comment in quiz-store.ts — that contract is deliberate). Clearing
// banked points is the master reset's job. The confirm copy below says so
// in as many words; keep the two in step.

//
// The pure model (types, validation, payload builders, confirmation copy) is
// in admin-quiz-model.ts and the form in admin-quiz-form.tsx; both are
// re-exported here so tests and callers keep one import path.
