// The ordered-list arithmetic the module admin panels (quiz, classic, ai)
// share. Every panel holds a list of admin rows whose public half carries an
// `id` and an `order`; the quiz's live at `row.question`, classic's and ai's
// at `row.challenge`. That accessor difference is the ONLY thing that
// separated three copies of sort/upsert/next-position and two copies of the
// drag/keyboard reorder, so it is expressed once here as a small accessors
// triple each panel defines for its row type.
//
// Everything here is pure, and exported, because it is the whole of the
// reordering logic: the drag handlers and the Move up/down buttons only work
// out a pair of indices and hand them here. That split is deliberate — this
// repo has no testing-library and deliberately does not want one, so drag
// events cannot be simulated in a unit test; keeping every decision about
// what the new order values ARE inside plain functions means the untestable
// part is reduced to "which two numbers get passed in".
