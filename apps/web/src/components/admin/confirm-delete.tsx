// The delete confirmation the module admin panels (quiz, classic, ai) share:
// `ConfirmModal` in its destructive, type-to-confirm shape — Confirm stays
// disabled until the organizer types the item's own phrase (see
// components/admin/confirm-phrase.ts) — with the line a failed DELETE lands on
// rendered under the body, and Cancel ignored while the request is in flight
// so the modal cannot vanish from under a write that is still running.
//
// Presentational. The panel owns the target, the copy (its own
// `xDeleteConfirm` builder — the sentences differ per module and stay there),
// the pending flag and the error; this component only arranges them the one
// way all three panels did by hand.
