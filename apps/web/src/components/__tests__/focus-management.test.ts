// Focus must follow a control that gets replaced.
//
// Three places in this app swap the element the user just activated for a
// different one: the confirm dialog (mounts over the trigger), the challenge
// page's hint button (revealed text replaces the button), and the in-row hint
// chip (the confirm/cancel pair replaces the chip). In every case the HTML
// focus fixup
// rule applies — the browser does NOT move focus to the replacement, it drops
// focus on <body> — so without an explicit `.focus()` the user is silently
// returned to the top of the document mid-interaction.
//
// These are SOURCE-level assertions, deliberately. The repo renders components
// with `renderToStaticMarkup` and has no DOM environment; `team-card.test.tsx`
// records the standing decision not to add `@testing-library/react` for a
// single test. A ref-driven `.focus()` leaves no trace in static markup, so
// there is nothing to assert about the rendered output — what these guard is
// that the focus handling is not quietly deleted. A behavioural test needs a
// DOM environment and is worth its own change, not a smuggled dependency.
