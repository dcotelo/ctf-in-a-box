// GitHub redirects an authorize failure straight back to the app with
// `?error=<code>&error_description=<text>` — a suspended/deleted OAuth app,
// a contestant who cancelled the GitHub prompt, or a redirect URI GitHub
// doesn't recognize. Before this, the landing page read neither parameter:
// the sign-in button looked like it simply did nothing.
//
// Reuses the mock-data/hint notice's amber `ds-card` look (server-only
// components) but as `role="alert"`, since this is something that JUST
// happened on this exact page load, not page furniture present from every
// first paint — the opposite of teamless-notice's reasoning for skipping it.
