// module an organizer switched off mid-event (issue #175): the link was
// correct, the visitor may have had the page open a minute ago, and telling
// them their link is stale sends them looking for a better one that does not
// exist. See `(site)/quiz/not-found.tsx` and its siblings.
//
// Renders NO footer. The root `not-found.tsx` sits outside the `(site)` group
// and adds its own; the per-module boundaries are inside that group and
// inherit its layout, so putting one here would double it up.
