// Small OWASP category badge. When the code maps to a known OWASP page it
// renders as a link (new tab) to that Top-10 / API-Top-10 category; otherwise
// it's plain text. THE single implementation, shared by the per-app challenge
// breakdown (app-challenge-list.tsx) and the catalogue grid
// (challenge-grid.tsx) so the link, the label and the styling stay in one
// place — those two surfaces each carried their own copy until they drifted:
// one had the WCAG 2.5.8 pointer target, the other had a different title and
// a different type size.
//
// The badge resolves its own label and URL from the bare code via
// `owaspCategory`, so a caller only ever passes the code. Callers holding a
// resolved `OwaspCategory` pass `category.code`; nothing needs to pass the
// label, and nothing may pass a URL — a badge must never be able to point
// somewhere lib/owasp.ts didn't sanction.

/**
 * The linked and unlinked badges MUST NOT look alike at rest.
 *
 * They used to: both rendered `text-muted` inside a `border-white/10` chip,
 * and every link affordance sat behind `hover:` / `focus-visible:`. A reader
 * could not tell an "A03" that opens owasp.org from an "API9" that is inert
 * without moving a pointer onto it — and a touch user could not find out at
 * all, since neither hover nor `title` reaches them.
 *
 * So the link carries TWO resting cues, colour and an underline, for the
 * reason globals.css already gives for `.ds-link`: WCAG 1.4.1 (Use of Color,
 * Level A) will not accept colour as the only means of conveying that
 * something is a link. Hover and focus then strengthen what is already
 * visible rather than introducing it.
 *
 * Neither cue changes the badge's box, which matters: these sit in rows that
 * run to ~110 challenges, and a chip that grew by even a pixel would re-flow
 * the truncating name beside it on every row.
