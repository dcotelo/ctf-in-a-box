 * Next's server-startup hook: called once per server instance, and completes
 * before the first request is served.
 *
 * This is the right home for the EVENT_URL check specifically because of that
 * timing. Validating inside `lib/auth.ts` at import would also run during
 * `next build` (which sets NODE_ENV=production), turning a deployment warning
 * into a build failure on a machine that has no event config at all. Checking
 * per-request would be too late — by the first request the cookie policy is
 * already settled, and an organizer would learn about it from a log line
 * buried under traffic instead of a server that refused to come up.
 *
 * The Edge runtime loads this file too; the check is pure string work with no
 * Node built-ins, so it runs identically in both.
