// The app's error boundary. Sits at the root segment, so it catches anything
// thrown by a page, by a nested `(site)` layout (the phase line's settings
// read), or by the landing page — everything except the root layout itself,
// which `global-error.tsx` covers.
//
// Why this is worth a file: the app had no error boundary at all, so ANY
// uncaught render error replaced the whole page with Next's unstyled default
// error screen — no header, no route out, and no way to retry short of the
// browser's reload button. An event is exactly the wrong moment to hand a
// contestant a dead end. This keeps the site's chrome, says plainly that the
// fault is ours and not theirs, and offers the retry first.
//
// Note what this is NOT for: a Redis outage does not land here. The store
// reads fail OPEN by design (see AGENTS.md on the pause/schedule contract),
// and a leaderboard with the store stopped still renders — verified by
// stopping `redis`/`srh` under the dev stack and getting a 200 with the page
// intact. So this boundary catches genuine render faults, not the outage that
// is already handled a layer down.
//
// The prop is `retry`, NOT the `reset` older App Router code uses: this app
// vendors Next 16.3, where `retry` became stable and re-fetches the segment's
// data. `reset` still exists but only clears the boundary and re-renders the
// same failed children, which for a data-read failure just fails again.
