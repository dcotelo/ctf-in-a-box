// Header/footer nav parity, asserted through the REAL layouts.
//
// The header is rendered by the root layout and the footer by the `(site)`
// layout — two files, two call sites, and (since the header groups 2+ module
// links into a "Challenges" dropdown while the footer stays flat) two
// deliberately different SHAPES built from one shared resolved-modules read.
// They drifted once already, before the grouping existed: the header resolved
// its links from the module registry with the organizer's renames applied
// while the footer imported `site.ts`'s static `navLinks`, so a renamed
// module showed one label up top and a different one at the bottom of the
// very same page. Fixing the footer once doesn't stop that recurring;
// asserting both derive from the same resolved modules does.
//
// So this deliberately renders the actual layout components rather than
// feeding both a hand-built list (which would pass no matter what the layouts
// do). Everything stubbed below is orthogonal to nav links: fonts, the
// session-reading client controls, and the server-only settings read.

// This mock config enables two modules with nav entries (secure-development,

// into one "Challenges" dropdown (see buildNavGroups) instead of rendering
// two top-level links. That dropdown's items sit behind a `useState` toggle
// that starts closed, so — per this repo's testing rule that anything behind
// a client-side toggle never appears in `renderToStaticMarkup` — the header's
// initial render exposes neither module href as a plain `<a>`; only the
// footer (which stays flat, per design) does.
//
// The header/footer split this file used to pin was "the same static list,
// rendered two different ways." The two anti-drift assertions that actually
// carry that guarantee now are: the footer-label check below (an un-renamed
// module's `nav.label` survives, an override still wins — read straight off
// the rendered `(site)` layout) and the closed-trigger check after it (the
// header really did collapse into a dropdown, proven off the rendered root
// layout, not off a hand-called builder). Both render the REAL layout
// components, so a regression in either one's wiring — reverting the footer
// to `site.ts`'s static list, or the header silently falling back to flat
// links — fails a test here.
//
// A third assertion used to sit here comparing `getNavLinks()`/
// `getNavGroups()` against `buildNavLinks(resolved)`/`buildNavGroups(resolved)`
// called directly. That was a tautology, not a test: `getNavLinks` IS
// `buildNavLinks(await getResolvedModules())` verbatim (see
// resolved-modules.ts), so the assertion re-ran the exact same two lines of
// code on both sides of `toEqual` and could not fail without also changing
// what it was "checking" — it implied coverage of the shared-resolved-modules
// property that the render-based assertions below already provide for real.
// Removed rather than kept for looks. If you're tempted to re-add a
// direct-call comparison like it, don't: prove the property by rendering,
// the way the two assertions below do.
