/**
 * Per-team support operations (issue #168).
 *
 *   POST   {slug, action:"remove-member"|"transfer-captain", login}
 *   DELETE {slug}   disband
 *
 * These are the captain-only actions in `team-store.ts`, available to an
 * organizer. They exist because the captain-only path is blocked *exactly*
 * when the captain is unreachable, which is when support is needed: a team
 * whose captain has vanished cannot rename, remove a member, regenerate its
 * code, or disband, and nothing else can rescue it.
 *
 * Unlike the contestant routes, the acting login is NOT the subject — an
 * organizer acts on a team they are not a member of. The store's scripts still
 * verify the team exists and the target is a member in the same atomic step as
 * the write, so an admin override is not the one path that races with a
 * contestant clicking Leave.
