/**
 * Event engagement metrics (issue #169).
 *
 *   GET               JSON
 *   GET ?format=csv   the per-challenge table, for a spreadsheet
 *
 * ADMIN-ONLY, and it stays that way. The aggregates themselves are harmless —
 * a per-challenge solve rate is fine to publish — but this payload is computed
 * from per-contestant rows, and every future field added to it is one edit away
 * from carrying a login. Gating the endpoint means that edit cannot become a
 * disclosure by accident. A public post-event summary, if one is ever wanted,
 * should be an explicit export of chosen aggregates, not this route with its
 * guard removed.
 *
 * Nothing here is fetched from a fork, and this route is unrelated to
 * `/api/public/scoring` — that one is read-only, policy-only, and fork-facing
 * (ADR 46). Metrics neither reads from it nor adds a write counterpart, because
 * the only credential a fork can hold is one every contestant can read, which
 * would make contestant-reported engagement numbers forgeable by contestants.
 *
 * Uncached: an organizer refreshing this mid-event wants the current number,
 * and the request rate is one per click.
