/**
 * Organizer authoring surface for the classic (flag) module: list (GET),
 * create-or-update a challenge or replace the category list (POST), and
 * delete a challenge (DELETE). Gated by `requireAdmin` throughout; every
 * write appends a line to the same `ctf:admin:audit` trail `admin-store`'s
 * settings/reset/seed writers and the quiz admin route use.
 *
 * This is the one surface that may return a challenge's flag. GET calls
 * `listChallengesForAdmin()`, so each row carries `{ challenge, flag }` and
 * the edit form can prefill the flag an organizer is editing — an organizer
 * fixing a typo must not have to retype the whole flag from memory and risk
 * silently redefining what counts as solved. That is sound precisely because
 * `requireAdmin` runs FIRST, before any store read: anyone past it can
 * already rewrite or delete the flag outright. The contestant path is
 * untouched and stays flagless — `/flags` calls `listChallenges()`, which
 * never reads `ctf:classic:flag`/`ctf:classic:flagnorm` at all.
 *
 * The POST payload is runtime-shape-checked field by field, rejecting any key
 * it doesn't explicitly allow, BEFORE it ever reaches `upsertChallenge` or
 * `setCategories`. This matters because TypeScript only rejects excess
 * properties on object LITERALS, not on parsed JSON — without this check, a
 * crafted request body could smuggle an extra key straight through to the
 * store. `parseChallengePayload` / `parseCategoriesPayload` below are the
 * guard: unknown keys, wrong types, or a missing field all fail closed with a
 * 400, never a partially-trusted write.
 *
 * POST carries FOUR distinct payload shapes on the SAME route rather than a
 * separate endpoint per resource: a body with exactly one key, `categories`
 * (an array), replaces the category list; one with exactly `renameCategory`
 * ({from, to}) renames a single category and carries its challenges across
 * (#304 — the array shape cannot express that, since a renamed entry is
 * indistinguishable from one removed plus one added); one with exactly
 * `import` (a string) bulk-imports a challenge bundle; anything else is
 * parsed as a challenge-plus-flag upsert. The four key sets never overlap,
 * so the shape alone is enough to dispatch — no extra discriminator field for
 * a caller to get wrong. See the exported `*_KEYS` constants below and the
 * route test's "keeps every payload key set pairwise disjoint" case, which
 * checks every PAIR among them (not just one hand-picked pair) so a future
 * fourth shape is covered by adding one line to that test's `sets` array,
 * rather than a second bespoke assertion.
 *
 * The `import` shape carries the bundle as raw TEXT, never a pre-parsed
 * object: this route re-parses and re-validates it with `parseBundle` (the
 * same validator the admin bulk-import UI runs client-side) before ever
 * calling `importBundle`, so a client that skipped or weakened its own
 * validation cannot write anything the single-challenge path above would
 * have rejected. `importBundle` itself trusts its input completely — see its
 * own doc comment in classic-store.ts — which is exactly why this route must
 * never call it with anything that hasn't been through `parseBundle` first.
