/**
 * Organizer authoring surface for the quiz module: list (GET), create-or-
 * update (POST), and delete (DELETE) questions. Gated by `requireAdmin`
 * throughout; every write appends a line to the same `ctf:admin:audit`
 * trail `admin-store`'s settings/reset/seed writers use.
 *
 * This is the one surface that may return the answer key. GET calls
 * `listQuestionsForAdmin()`, so each row carries `{ question, correct }` and
 * the edit form can prefill which choices are currently right — an organizer
 * fixing a typo must not have to re-pick the answer from memory and risk
 * silently redefining it for every contestant. That is sound precisely
 * because `requireAdmin` runs FIRST, before any store read: anyone past it
 * can already rewrite or delete the answer outright. The contestant path is
 * untouched and stays keyless — `/quiz` calls `listQuestions()`, which never
 * reads `ctf:quiz:key` at all.
 *
 * The POST payload is runtime-shape-checked field by field, rejecting any
 * key it doesn't explicitly allow, BEFORE it ever reaches `upsertQuestion`.
 * This matters because TypeScript only rejects excess properties on object
 * LITERALS, not on parsed JSON — without this check, a crafted request body
 * could smuggle an extra key (e.g. a `points` field on a choice object)
 * straight through to the store, and `upsertQuestion`/GRADE_SCRIPT would
 * have no way to know that value wasn't meant to be there. `parseChoice`
 * and `parseQuestionPayload` below are the guard: unknown keys, wrong
 * types, or missing fields on the question OR any of its choices all fail
 * closed with a 400, never a partially-trusted write.
 *
 * POST carries TWO distinct payload shapes on the SAME route rather than a
 * second endpoint, mirroring the classic admin route: a body whose only key
 * is `import` (a string) bulk-imports a question bundle; anything else is
 * treated as a single question. The two are kept mutually exclusive by
 * `hasOnlyKeys` on both sides — a body carrying `import` AND any question key
 * matches neither shape and falls through to the 400 catch-all, rather than
 * being silently read as either.
 *
 * The `import` shape carries the bundle as raw TEXT, never a pre-parsed
 * object. The route re-parses and re-validates it server-side with
 * `parseBundle` (the same validator the admin bulk-import UI runs
 * client-side) before ever calling `importBundle`, so a client that skipped
 * or weakened its own validation cannot write anything the single-question
 * path above would have rejected. `importBundle` itself trusts its input
 * completely — see its own doc comment in quiz-store.ts — which is exactly
 * why this route must never call it with anything that hasn't been through
 * `parseBundle` first.
