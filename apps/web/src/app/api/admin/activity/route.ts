 * One page of the activity log (issue #212), newest first.
 *
 *   GET ?offset=<n>&limit=<n>   ->  { entries, total }
 *
 * ADMIN-ONLY, and it stays that way: every entry names a contestant. The
 * entries themselves carry ids only — never flags, answers, or hint text
 * (see activity-log.ts, rule 2) — but "who was signed in when" is still
 * per-person data with no business on a public surface.
 *
 * Filtering (by type, by login) happens client-side in the Activity tab over
 * the pages it has loaded: the whole list is capped at a few thousand short
 * rows, and a server-side filter would mean a second pagination contract
 * ("offset within the filtered view") for no real saving.
 *
 * Uncached: an organizer refreshing this mid-event wants the current tail.
