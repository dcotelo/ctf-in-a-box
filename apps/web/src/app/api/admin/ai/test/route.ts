/**
 * The organizer's "Send test" button for one ai-module challenge (spec §8.2).
 *
 * Mints a 15-minute demo launch token for the ADMIN'S OWN login, signs a demo
 * solve-event body with the challenge's real signing key, and calls the REAL
 * `/api/ai/event` handler in-process — the exact code path a live integration
 * exercises — with `dryRun: true`, hard-coded here and NEVER taken from the
 * caller's body: this route's whole safety story is that dryRun cannot be
 * turned off from the outside, and the identity minted into the token is
 * always the calling admin's own login, never a caller-supplied `sub`. A dry
 * run writes nothing (see `event/route.ts`'s own doc comment), which is what
 * makes this safe to click against a live event: no nonce is claimed, no
 * points are awarded.
 *
 * This route deliberately does NOT re-implement any of `/api/ai/event`'s
 * checks (signature, token, mode, rate limit, team, schedule). It relays that
 * handler's status and JSON body verbatim, including a refusal — a
 * flag-mode challenge's `wrong-mode`, say — so the admin panel always shows
 * the same verdict a real integration would get, never a synthetic one this
 * route invented. The ONE exception is the pre-invocation signing-key check
 * below: it has to run before the event handler is even reachable (there is
 * no key to sign the demo event with otherwise), so its `no-signing-key`
 * refusal is this route's own, not a relay — see that check's comment.
 *
 * `requireAdmin` runs FIRST, before any store read, mint or invocation:
 * exactly `admin/ai/route.ts`'s idiom, because minting a token — even a
 * throwaway demo one — is a write-shaped operation that must never run for
 * an unauthenticated caller.
 *
 * The launch PRIVATE key (from `getAiLaunchKeys`) and the challenge's event
 * signing key are used only to produce signatures; neither is ever placed in
 * the response body or handed to `console.error`.
