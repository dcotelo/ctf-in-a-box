/**
 * Submits a graded answer for one quiz question.
 *
 * `answerQuestion` is authoritative on the attempt cap, cooldown, and
 * grading (its Lua script re-checks everything atomically) — this route
 * never re-implements or second-guesses that enforcement. It only derives
 * `login` from the session (never the request body) and maps the store's
 * result to a status code:
 *   - unauthenticated -> 401
 *   - session with no GitHub login -> 400
 *   - pre-event gate active, no valid unlock cookie -> 403 { error: "gate" }
 *   - malformed questionId/choices -> 400
 *   - unknown/missing question -> 404
 *   - gate refusal (paused/answered/exhausted/cooldown/unavailable) -> 403
 *   - grading script failure -> 503
 *   - success -> 200
 *
 * The pre-event gate check runs after authentication (so an unauthenticated
 * caller still gets the more specific 401) and before `answerQuestion` is
 * ever called — a refusal here can never follow a write that already
 * happened. See `requireGatePassed` (apps/web/src/lib/gate-request.ts) and
 * docs/modules.md §5.8.
 *
 * No response from this route can ever reveal the correct choice ids:
 * `AnswerResult` (quiz-store's return type) never carries them, by
 * construction — there is no field here to leak.
