/**
 * Submits one flag against one classic challenge.
 *
 * `submitFlag` is authoritative on the pause/schedule gate, the already-
 * solved guard, the cooldown, and the grading itself (its Lua script
 * re-checks everything atomically) — this route never re-implements or
 * second-guesses that enforcement. It only derives `login` from the session
 * (never the request body — a body-supplied login would be an account-
 * impersonation hole) and maps the store's result to a status code:
 *   - unauthenticated -> 401
 *   - session with no GitHub login -> 400
 *   - pre-event gate active, no valid unlock cookie -> 403 { error: "gate" }
 *   - malformed challengeId/flag -> 400
 *   - unknown/deleted challenge -> 404
 *   - gate refusal (paused/solved/cooldown/unavailable) -> 403
 *   - grading script failure -> 503
 *   - success -> 200
 *
 * The pre-event gate check runs after authentication (so an unauthenticated
 * caller still gets the more specific 401) and before `submitFlag` is ever
 * called — a refusal here can never follow a write that already happened.
 * See `requireGatePassed` (apps/web/src/lib/gate-request.ts) and docs/modules.md
 * §5.8.
 *
 * Validating `challengeId` against `CLASSIC_ID_RE` here, before the store
 * call, is what lets a store-reported `"invalid"` mean "unknown challenge"
 * (404) rather than "malformed" (400) — this route has already ruled out the
 * shape problem by the time it calls `submitFlag`.
 *
 * No response from this route can ever reveal the submitted flag or a stored
 * one: `SubmitResult` (classic-store's return type) never carries either, by
 * construction — there is no field here to leak.
