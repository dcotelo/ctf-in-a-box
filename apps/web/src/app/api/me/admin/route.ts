/**
 * "Is the CURRENT session an admin?" — one boolean, for menu visibility.
 *
 * The header's admin link is rendered by a Client Component, which can read
 * neither Redis nor `ADMIN_LOGINS` (server-only, config v2) — so this route
 * is the only way it learns admin status at all, for env admins and runtime
 * grants alike (issue #147).
 *
 * This route discloses NOTHING but the caller's own status: no list, no other
 * logins, and it is not gated on being an admin — a non-admin gets `false`,
 * which they could infer anyway from the panel 403ing. That is why it lives
 * under /api/me rather than /api/admin: `requireAdmin` on it would make it
 * useless for the one question it answers.
 *
 * Signed out is `false`, not 401: the nav asks this on every signed-in mount
 * and an error status there would be noise, not information.
