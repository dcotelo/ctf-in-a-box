 * Creates a team of one, named after the caller (issue #153).
 *
 * Its own route rather than a flag on POST /api/team because the team NAME is
 * derived server-side from the session's login and is not an input. A `solo:
 * true` field on the create route would have to ignore any `name` the body
 * carried, and a body field that is silently ignored is a body field somebody
 * eventually relies on.
 *
 * There is nothing to read from the request at all — which is the point: the
 * name comes from the session, so a caller cannot use this to mint a team
 * named after somebody else.
