/**
 * Submits one flag against one ai challenge, on behalf of an externally
 * hosted challenge acting for a player.
 *
 * COOKIE-BLIND BY DESIGN. This route never imports `@/lib/auth`,
 * `next/headers` or `@/lib/gate-request`, and reads no cookie at all —
 * identity is `token.sub`, the launch token's subject, and nothing else. That
 * is what makes CORS `*` on this endpoint safe rather than a CSRF hole: a
 * forged cross-site POST carries no session to ride on, because there is no
 * session-based check here to bypass. `src/proxy.ts` exempts `/api/ai/` from
 * the app's usual same-origin enforcement on exactly this reasoning — see its
 * `AI_PREFIX` comment. If this route ever starts reading a cookie, that
 * exemption becomes a hole, not a convenience.
 *
 * The pre-event gate is enforced once, at token-mint time, not here — see
 * spec §6.5. A launch token in hand already proves the box minted it after
 * that gate passed; this route does not re-check it, the same way it does not
 * re-check any other launch-time decision.
 *
 * That enforcement is an EXPLICIT `requireGatePassed()` call in
 * `(site)/ai/[id]/page.tsx`, above the mint (and a second one in that page's
 * `actions.ts`, the in-box form's server half). It is NOT inherited from
 * `proxy.ts`: `GATED_ROUTES` matches exact paths, so the middleware covers
 * `/ai` and never `/ai/<id>` — which is the route that mints.
 *
 * `submitAiFlag` remains authoritative on pause, cooldown, already-solved and
 * grading — its Lua script re-checks all of that atomically. This route
 * re-implements none of it; it only:
 *   - validates the body shape (400 `invalid-request`)
 *   - reads the challenge id from the token's `aud`, unverified, to select
 *     which public key and audience to verify against (401 `invalid-token`
 *     for a missing or malformed `aud`)
 *   - verifies the token against the module's launch public key — no
 *     per-challenge secret is read on this path at all, because a launch
 *     token is proof the box minted it and the flag itself is the
 *     proof-of-solve (401 `invalid-token` / `expired`)
 *   - rate limits per `token.sub` (429, `Retry-After`)
 *   - resolves the challenge and its `mode` via `listAiChallenges()` (404
 *     `unknown-challenge`; 409 `wrong-mode` for an event-only challenge)
 *   - checks `hasTeam(claims.sub)` — a ROUTE-level check PR 1's store never
 *     took on, matching `classic/submit/route.ts`'s split exactly (403
 *     `no-team`, failing OPEN so a Redis blip lets a solve through rather
 *     than drop it)
 *   - calls `submitAiFlag` and maps its result with `aiAwardResponse`
 *
 * The pipeline never lets a refusal follow a write: every check above runs
 * before `submitAiFlag` is called, and `submitAiFlag` itself never carries
 * the flag back in its result — there is no field here to leak a submitted or
 * stored flag through.
 *
 * Wrapped in `aiRoute`, so a store read that THROWS (an Upstash blip) leaves
 * here as a CORS-readable 503 `{error:"unavailable"}` rather than a bare 500
 * an external caller cannot even see the status of.
