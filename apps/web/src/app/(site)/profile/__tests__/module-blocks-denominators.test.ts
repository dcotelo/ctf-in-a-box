// A progress row's two halves come from different places, and deleting a
// solved challenge splits them (issue #330).
//
// The numerator counts SOLVE RECORDS, which survive deletion on purpose — the
// admin delete dialog promises it: "Points already banked for it stay on the
// leaderboard." The denominator counts the LIVE CATALOGUE, which no longer has
// the challenge in it. So an organizer who deletes two solved AI challenges
// mid-event hands every affected contestant:
//
//     AI Challenges   5 / 5 cleared   870 / 850 pts
//
// with a bar filled past its own end, while the board they browse says 3 / 3.
//
// Clamping the totals stops the ratio exceeding one but is not the union, and
// the difference is visible: five live items with three solved, two unsolved
// and two solved-then-deleted is 5 / 7, where a clamp reports 5 / 5 and calls a
// module finished that still has two challenges waiting. These pin the union,
// for every module and both halves of the row.
