// Server Component: reads the session and the quiz's public-safe data
// (`listQuestions()` never returns an answer key — see quiz-store.ts), then
// derives each question's PER-VIEWER status server-side and hands a plain
// view model down to <QuizBoard>. Data (and auth) in, interactivity down —
// same split as leaderboard/page.tsx.
//
// Gated on the module registry rather than on auth: this route only exists
// at all when the quiz module is enabled (module contract §5.4), so an
// event without the quiz module 404s here exactly like any other unknown
// route. Session is optional — a signed-out visitor can still see the
// questions, same as the public leaderboard; only submitting requires auth,
// enforced by /api/quiz/answer itself.

 *  — reimplemented here purely for display, using data this page already
 *  has (one `getViewerQuiz` pipeline + the current admin settings) instead
 *  of an extra `quizGate` round trip per question. A stale or drifted read
 *  here is a display nit at worst: `answerQuestion`'s Lua script re-checks
 *  both, atomically, against fresh state, and is the only thing that
 *  actually enforces the cap or the cooldown.
 *
 *  `now` defaults to `Date.now()` (read here, in a plain helper, rather than
 *  in the page component's own body) — same reason `formatRelativeTime`
 *  takes `now` as a parameter: a Server Component's render function must
 *  stay a pure function of its props for React's rules (no impure
 *  `Date.now()`/`Math.random()` calls in the component body itself). */
