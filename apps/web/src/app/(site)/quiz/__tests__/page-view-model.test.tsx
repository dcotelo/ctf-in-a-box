// The keyless-contestant guarantee, pinned at the PAGE level.
//
// quiz-board.test.tsx already proves <QuizBoard> won't echo a leaked field
// into markup even if one somehow reaches it. This proves the field never
// reaches it in the first place: whatever `listQuestions()` hands back,
// /quiz's view model is built field by field from the public `Question`
// shape, so an answer key cannot ride along.
//
// That property became worth pinning separately once `GET /api/admin/quiz`
// started returning correct sets: the store now HAS a reader that returns the
// key (`listQuestionsForAdmin`), so "no caller ever holds one" is no longer
// true globally — only on this path. Hence a test that watches this path
// specifically, with a store deliberately leaking, rather than trusting the
// contestant page to keep doing the right thing by inspection.
//
// QuizBoard is mocked here (unlike page.test.tsx, which renders it for real)
// purely to capture the props it is handed — the view model itself, before
// any rendering can hide a field.
