// One name per module, for the panel's own text (audit F25).
//
// The panel had four names for the same two things: a classic solve was a
// "flag solve" in Activity, under a tab called "Classic CTF", while the nav
// said "Flags"; Insights called Secure Development "Sec-dev" and printed the
// raw registry ids `classic` and `ai` in a column headed Module. Same thing,
// four names, on one screen — which costs nothing until an organizer has to
// search their own panel for a word they read a minute ago.
//
// The tab label is canonical, and the tab label is the registry's
// `displayName`. This map is that, in a form the client components can read:
// `lib/modules.ts` is importable from a client component, but its resolved
// module objects deliberately drop `displayName` (see the `ResolvedModule`
// comment there) and neither tab that needs these strings is handed one. The
// duplication is therefore real, and a test pins every entry against the
// registry so it cannot drift.
//
// An event that RENAMES a module in `event.yaml` is not covered here: the
// rename reaches the contestant-facing surfaces and the tab, and these two
// admin readouts keep the registry name. Naming them after the registry is
// still strictly better than `ai` and "Sec-dev", and threading a resolved
// module list into Activity and Insights is a bigger change than this finding
// asks for.
