// The admin panel's URL⇄tab rules, in a module with NO `"use client"` marker.
//
// All three are needed on BOTH sides of the RSC boundary: the two routes
// resolve a request's tab on the server (`page.tsx`, `[tab]/page.tsx`), while
// the sidebar's `href`, the pushState after a click and the popstate handler
// all run in the browser. They lived in admin-controls.tsx, which is a Client
// Component — and a function exported from a `"use client"` module is a client
// REFERENCE, not a callable. Calling one from a Server Component throws
//
//   Error: Attempted to call resolveAdminTab() from the server but
//   resolveAdminTab is on the client.
//
// at request time, which took every `/admin` URL to the error boundary in
// production while `next build`, vitest and CI all stayed green (issue #312):
// there is no RSC boundary in the unit tests, so `"use client"` is inert there
// and the call succeeds. Nothing but a real request could see it.
//
// So the rules live here and admin-controls.tsx re-exports them for its client
// callers — the same shape `team-limits.ts` and `admin-admins.ts` already use,
// for the same reason: what a module imports is part of its contract. Keep this
// file dependency-free and free of `"use client"`; importing anything that
// carries the marker would put it back on the client side of the boundary.
