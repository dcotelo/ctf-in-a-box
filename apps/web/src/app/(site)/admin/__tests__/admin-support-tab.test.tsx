// @testing-library/react is not a dependency of this repo and must not be
// added just for this test. The contestant card and the confirm modals on
// this tab sit behind `useState` (a lookup has to return first), so a static
// render of the tab shows only the search form. What the card SAYS about a
// contestant — and what the reset confirm claims it will wipe — is therefore
// proven through the exported pure builders the component renders from,
// mirroring how `questionDeleteConfirm`/`challengeDeleteConfirm` are proven
// on the module panels.
