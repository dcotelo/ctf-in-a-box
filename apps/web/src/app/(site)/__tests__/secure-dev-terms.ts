// The secure-development vocabulary, enumerated once and asserted ABSENT by
// every "this event doesn't run that module" page suite.
//
// This list is the load-bearing part of those tests, and it has to be
// deliberately exhaustive rather than illustrative. The landing page's
// equivalent check originally covered "pull request", "fork" and
// "Browse targets" but NOT "patched" — and "patched" was the one string that
// had actually leaked (a progress card promising a "patched and non-patched
// count per app" on an event with nothing to patch). The hole sat exactly
// where the bug was.
//
// The rule, learned the hard way three times on this work: when a term
// threatens a false positive, NARROW the match — never drop the term. A
// dropped term is a silent hole in the shape of the thing it named. "target"
// was dropped once here on the grounds that `target="_blank"` made it
// unusable, and a mutation putting *"Browse the targets, then point your AI
// agent at a target"* into the platform frame sailed through the whole
// suite. It is a bounded pattern now, not an omission.
//
// Narrowing in force:
//   - "repo" as a bare substring matches "Report it to an organizer" — it is a
//     word-boundary pattern instead, which does not fire inside "Report".
//   - "target" matches every `target="_blank"` attribute — a word-boundary
//     pattern with a `(?!=)` lookahead keeps the prose and drops the
//     attribute. It also matches /code-of-conduct's "you do not need to be
//     the target to report something", where the word means the person a
//     behaviour is aimed at — a `be the` lookbehind drops that sense and
//     keeps every other use. The alternative was rewriting the sentence,
//     which is exactly what this file's own rule forbids: it is platform
//     copy, it renders on secure-development events too, and the replacement
//     ("to have been harmed yourself") also narrowed WHO is told to report.
//   - "commit" matches the platform's own "what taking part commits you to"
//     on /terms and /code-of-conduct — a `(?!\s+you)` lookahead keeps
//     "the commit message" and drops the obligation sense.
//   - "flag" matches the quiz's own "There are no flags to submit" — only the
//     secure-development phrase "flag hunting" is listed.
//   - "PR" and "CI" match inside ordinary words, so they are word-boundary
//     regexes too.
//
// LIVE vs LATENT. Every term, and every LIVE pattern, is proven live by
// secure-dev-terms.test.ts: it renders the pages that ARE supposed to carry
// this vocabulary and asserts each one matches something. A term that rots
// into decoration — as "repository" and the unescaped "repo's" both silently
// had — fails there.
//
// A handful of terms name the workflow just as squarely but do not happen to
// appear in today's shipped copy: merge, diff, rebase, CVE. Leaving them out
// left a hole exactly the shape of the words nobody had written yet — a
// reviewer's mutation, *"Merge your diff for the CVE into WebGoat, then clone
// the repository"*, dropped into unconditional copy on /rules, /how-to-play
// and /profile and left all three quiz-only suites green. They are listed as
// LATENT and proven against SPECIMENS instead: the check is the same in
// substance (the pattern must actually fire on the copy it names) without
// pretending the shipped pages contain a word they do not. Absence is
// asserted against all of them alike — `findSecureDevLeaks` does not
// distinguish.
