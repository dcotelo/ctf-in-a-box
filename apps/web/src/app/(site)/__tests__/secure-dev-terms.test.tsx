// The term list checks itself here.
//
// `secure-dev-terms.ts` is only worth anything if every entry in it actually
// names copy that exists. A term that matches nothing is not a safety net,
// it is decoration — and it fails silently, since the suites that use the
// list only ever assert ABSENCE, which a dead term satisfies trivially. Two
// had already rotted this way: `repository` names nothing on either page, and
// `repo's` could never fire because React escapes the apostrophe to
// `&#x27;`. An aggregate "more than half of them match" check did not notice
// either.
//
// So: render the pages that ARE supposed to carry the secure-development
// vocabulary, on the shipped event config, and require EVERY term and EVERY
// live pattern to match something in the combined markup. A term that stops
// matching fails here, loudly, instead of quietly weakening the quiz-only
// suites.
//
// The corpus is every page whose quiz-only counterpart asserts absence. It
// started as /how-to-play and /rules alone, which is how the app-name and
// repository vocabulary came to be missing from the list: the pages carrying
// it — the FAQ, the terms, the 404 — were outside both nets at once.
//
// The LATENT patterns are proven against `SECURE_DEV_SPECIMENS` instead; see
// the header note in secure-dev-terms.ts for why they are not required to
// match the shipped render.
