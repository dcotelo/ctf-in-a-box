// /terms on an event whose enabled modules contribute no terms at all — the
// case a future module ships before it has written any, and the reason each
// section has a fallback list. Without them this page renders an empty "Scope
// of authorized testing": a participation-terms page that states no scope at
// all is worse than a generic one, because that section is the one contestants
// read to find out what they are permitted to attack.
//
// A module-free config is the simplest way to reach that state (a module with
// no `terms` block behaves identically — `getModuleTerms` returns undefined
// either way). Mirrors rules/__tests__/page-no-modules.test.tsx.
