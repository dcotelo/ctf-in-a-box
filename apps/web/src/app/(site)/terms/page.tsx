// Participation terms for the CTF specifically. This is not a general site
// Terms of Service — OWASP publishes no ToS, and its General Disclaimer is the
// governing document, linked below. What's here is limited to what taking part
// in this competition actually commits you to.
//
// A PLATFORM frame with module contributions, like /rules and /faq. Every
// participation term this kit has written names a module's own artifacts —
// what you submit, where you may test, what a point is worth — so the modules
// own them, and the platform keeps the two that hold on any event (prizes,
// disputes) plus a fallback list per section.
//
// The scope section is why this page mattered most: with no module owning it,
// an event with no targets rendered "Your authorization to test covers the 0
// challenge targets only: ," — a legal scope clause that authorized nothing,
// on the page that tells contestants what they are permitted to attack. The
// fallbacks below exist so that section can never be empty either.
//
// Server Component, and must stay one: `ModuleTerms` is a FUNCTION of the live
// event facts, called here so only plain data is rendered.
