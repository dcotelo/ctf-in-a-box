// /rules on a quiz-only event. The rules page is quieter than /how-to-play
// but it had the same bug: "Submit every pull request from the account you
// signed in with", a scope rule listing patch targets, and a hint-cost rule
// are secure-development's, not the platform's, and they were unconditional.
//
// Same negative-assertion discipline, same enumerated term list. Own file for
// the usual `vi.mock` hoisting reason.
