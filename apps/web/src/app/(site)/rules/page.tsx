// /rules is a PLATFORM frame with module contributions, on the same basis as
// /how-to-play: the platform owns the section headings and the rules that hold
// on any event whatsoever (team size, the code of conduct, prizes, organizer
// decisions), and each enabled module contributes the rules that name its own
// artifacts. "Submit every pull request from the account you signed in with"
// and "Revealing a hint deducts points" are not event-wide rules — they are
// secure-development's, and on a quiz-only event they describe a game that
// isn't running.
//
// Server Component, and must stay one: `ModuleRules` is a FUNCTION of the
// live target list, called here so only plain data is rendered. See
// lib/modules.ts for why it never rides on a ResolvedModule.
