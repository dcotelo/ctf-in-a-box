// Shareable team-join link (issue #45).
//
// A captain sends `/join/<code>` instead of dictating six characters over a
// noisy room. The page RESOLVES the code and shows which team it belongs to;
// the join itself is a POST from the button, never a side effect of the GET.
// A link preview or a prefetch must never put someone on a team.
//
// The code lives in the PATH rather than a query string so it survives the
// GitHub sign-in round-trip as the callback URL, with nothing to stash and
// nothing to lose.
