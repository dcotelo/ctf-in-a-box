// The in-box flag form's server half — spec §6.1's 2026-09-02 amendment.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A FETCH. `/api/ai/submit` is the EXTERNAL
// surface: it identifies its caller by the launch token in the body, is
// cookie-blind, CORS-open and exempt from the app's same-origin check
// (`proxy.ts`'s `AI_PREFIX`) precisely because it reads no cookie. The token
// it wants exists in exactly one place — the launcher's href — and §7 keeps
// it there, so the form on `/ai/[id]` has nothing to authenticate with and
// cannot call that route at all. A Server Action is the other half of the
// same design: identity comes from the session cookie, the token is never
// materialised on the client, and the action sits OUTSIDE the `/api/ai/`
// CSRF exemption, so Next's own server-action origin enforcement applies to
// the cookie it reads.
//
// THIS IS A SECURITY BOUNDARY, NOT A CONVENIENCE WRAPPER. A Server Action is
// a POST endpoint with a generated id: anything that can reach the page can
// reach it directly, so it re-checks every gate the page's render checked,
// in the page's own order — module live, pre-event gate, session, team —
// before the store is touched. Nothing here may return (or import) anything
// carrying a token, a flag or a signing key; `SubmitResponse` has no field
// one could ride in.
//
// The team check is `hasTeam`, not `redirectIfTeamless`: an action answers
// the form it was called from, and a redirect thrown at a `fetch`-style call
// is not an answer. It also takes NO admin exemption — matching
// `api/ai/submit/route.ts` and `api/classic/submit/route.ts`, which are the
// boundary that actually holds; `require-team.ts` documents why the page-level
// exemption is not a scoring hole.
