// One ai challenge, on its own URL — mirrors classic's flags/[id]/page.tsx
// structurally (same session/gate/load order, same field-by-field view
// model), with the module's two differences:
//
//   1. THE LAUNCHER. A signed-in viewer gets a personal, one-click link to
//      the externally hosted challenge — this is the ONE place in the app
//      that mints it. `mintLaunchUrl` (ai-launch.ts) is called from behind
//      every gate this render already passed: the module-enabled check
//      above, a real session, and the team redirect below. No other route
//      calls it. A signed-out visitor sees a sign-in prompt where the
//      launcher would be, and the mint is never reached at all — there is no
//      branch that calls it without `login` in hand.
//   2. THE FORM. `mode: "event"` means the box never grades a typed flag for
//      this challenge, so no <ChallengeDetail> renders at all — the launcher
//      is the whole page. `flag`/`both` render the same shared component
//      classic uses, wired to the Server Action in ./actions.ts rather than
//      to a submit ROUTE: /api/ai/submit authenticates the launch token,
//      which never leaves the href above (spec §6.1's 2026-09-02 amendment).
//
// Gated exactly like /ai: the route 404s when the module is off, and 404s
// for an unknown or deleted challenge id (issue #209's dual-cause not-found,
// in `[id]/not-found.tsx`).

/**
 * The app's one trusted origin, for the launch token's `iss` claim —
 * NEVER the request's Host header, which a client fully controls. Two
 * existing checks already draw this same line for the same reason and this
 * follows them: `secure-url.ts` derives the session cookie's Secure flag from
 * `BETTER_AUTH_URL` alone (never a header), and `origin.ts`'s CSRF check
 * compares an incoming `Origin` against `new URL(BETTER_AUTH_URL).origin`,
 * again never inventing an expectation from the request itself.
 *
 * `BETTER_AUTH_URL` unset is a tolerated dev state, not an error, in both of
 * those: `secure-url.ts`'s own startup check passes it as `ok` outside
 * production, and `origin.ts` allows every request once there is "nothing to
 * compare against". A launch token still needs SOME string for `iss` — it is
 * never validated against anything server-side (`ai-token.ts`'s
 * `verifyLaunchToken` checks signature, expiry and audience; the external
 * integrator reads `iss` for its own logging) — so the safe answer here is
 * the shipped `.env.example` default's own origin, `http://localhost`, rather
 * than reading `headers()` for one.
