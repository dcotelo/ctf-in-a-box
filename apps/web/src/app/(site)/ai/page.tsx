// Server Component: reads the session and the ai module's public-safe data
// (`listAiChallenges()` never returns a flag, a hint or a signing key — see
// ai-store.ts), then derives each challenge's PER-VIEWER status server-side
// and hands a plain view model down to <ChallengeBoard>. Data (and auth) in,
// interactivity down — same split as classic's /flags/page.tsx, which this
// mirrors structurally.
//
// Gated on the module registry rather than on auth: this route only exists at
// all when the ai module is enabled (module contract §5.4), so an event
// without it 404s here exactly like any other unknown route. Session is
// optional — a signed-out visitor can still browse the board; only opening a
// challenge (its own page) mints anything, and only submitting a flag
// requires auth, enforced by /api/ai/submit itself.
//
// No hints in v1 (that wires in a later PR) — <ChallengeBoard> is left to its
// own empty `hintIds` default rather than this page passing one.
