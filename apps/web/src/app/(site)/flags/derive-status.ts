/** Derives this viewer's status for one challenge from the SAME solved/
 *  cooldown rule classic-store's `evaluateGate` enforces authoritatively at
 *  submit time — reimplemented here purely for display, using data the pages
 *  already have (one `getViewerClassic` pipeline + the current admin
 *  settings) instead of an extra round trip per challenge. A stale or
 *  drifted read here is a display nit at worst: `submitFlag`'s Lua script
 *  re-checks both, atomically, against fresh state, and is the only thing
 *  that actually enforces the solved guard or the cooldown.
 *
 *  Shared by the board (/flags) and the challenge page (/flags/[id]) so the
 *  tile a contestant clicked and the page it opens can never disagree about
 *  the same challenge's state.
 *
 *  `now` defaults to `Date.now()` (read here, in a plain helper, rather than
 *  in a page component's own body) so the Server Components stay pure
 *  functions of their props for React's rules. */
