// /faq on a quiz-only event.
//
// This page was 100% secure-development — "fork the target's repo", "open a
// pull request", "the scorer watches main", hints, PR authorship — and it is
// in the HEADER NAV, so a quiz-only event linked contestants to it from every
// page of the site.
//
// Same negative-assertion discipline as the /rules and /how-to-play suites,
// and the same shared term list. Own file for the usual `vi.mock` hoisting
// reason.
