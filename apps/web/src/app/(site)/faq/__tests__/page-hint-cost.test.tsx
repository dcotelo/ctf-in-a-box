// The FAQ's hint answer quotes a PRICE, and the price is an /admin runtime
// setting — any integer in [0, HINT_COST_MAX], not a constant.
//
// It shipped as the literal "10 points" (issue #315), so every organizer who
// moved the price served a FAQ that misquoted it, while `/challenges`, the
// reveal button and the challenge pages all rendered the real one. This file
// is the guard: the number on the page comes from the resolved config.
//
// Own file for the usual `vi.mock` hoisting reason, and because it needs the
// Upstash env set before `hint-store` is imported — `getHintNotice` short-
// circuits to the baked default when the credentials are absent, which would
// make an assertion on the configured value pass for the wrong reason.
