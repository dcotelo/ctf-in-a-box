// /faq is a PLATFORM frame with module contributions, on the same basis as
// /rules and /how-to-play. The platform owns the page furniture and the three
// questions that hold on any event whatsoever — can I compete solo, is there a
// prize, where do I find an organizer — and each enabled module contributes
// the questions that name its own artifacts.
//
// This page was 100% secure-development, and it is in the HEADER NAV: a
// quiz-only event linked contestants straight from its own navigation to a
// page telling them to fork a target, open a pull request, and wait for the
// scorer. Not an obscure corner.
//
// Server Component, and must stay one: `ModuleFaq` is a FUNCTION of the live
// event facts, called here so only plain data reaches the client accordion.
// See lib/modules.ts for why it never rides on a ResolvedModule.

  // — three identical collapsed rows, which reads as a bug rather than as
  // three answers. (It shipped because the only FAQ tests were quiz-only and
  // classic-only, and a single-module event cannot collide.)
  //
  // So: group by question text, keep first-seen order, and merge a collision
  // into one entry whose answer is labelled per module. Nothing is dropped
  // and no module has to reword a question to avoid its neighbours. A
  // single-module event takes the `length === 1` path and renders exactly as
  // it did before.
