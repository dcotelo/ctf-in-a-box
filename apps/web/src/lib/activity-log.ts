// The activity log (issue #212): one capped Redis list of who-did-what-when
// entries, feeding the admin panel's Activity tab. Two rules govern
// everything here, both from the issue:
//
//   1. FAIL-OPEN, ALWAYS. `logActivity` is called from inside sign-in, flag
//      submission and team mutations. A Redis blip losing a log line is
//      fine; a Redis blip failing a login or dropping a correct flag is
//      not. So the writer swallows every error and never throws.
//
//   2. `detail` CARRIES IDs ONLY, NEVER ANSWERS. Challenge/question ids and
//      team slugs — never flags, hint text, or submitted answers. The log
//      is admin-only today, but the rule is what keeps it safe to
//      screen-share mid-event and safe against any future loosening of who
//      can read it.
