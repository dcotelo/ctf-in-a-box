// First-login team steering (issue #217): every GitHub sign-in lands on

// BEFORE their original destination. The module-page redirect
// (require-team.ts) and the API refusals still hold as the backstop; this
// exists so the team step is met at sign-in, not discovered later — and it
// is the only place the secure-development path (whose scores arrive via
// the poller, with no app route to refuse a teamless login) gets covered at
// all.
//
// Pure decision logic only — the route handler (app/api/post-signin) does
// the session/store reads. Kept import-free so require-team.ts can take
// TEAM_SETUP_PATH from here without dragging next/navigation into anything.
