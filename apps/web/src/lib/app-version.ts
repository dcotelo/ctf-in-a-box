// What build is actually running, for `/health`.
//
// Three fields, because no one of them answers the question on its own:
//
//   * `version` — the repo-level tag this build was cut from
//     (`apps/web/package.json`, which CONTRIBUTING says tracks the current
//     tag). It only moves on a release, so it CANNOT tell you whether a
//     deploy happened: every commit between v0.4.0 and v0.5.0 reports
//     "0.4.0".
//   * `revision` — the commit. This is the field that answers "did my fix
//     reach the box yet", which is the reason this endpoint exists.
//   * `builtAt` — when the image was built. Distinguishes two deploys of the
//     SAME commit, which is otherwise invisible: a redeploy after a config
//     or secret change rebuilds the image without moving the sha.
//
// `revision` and `builtAt` arrive as build args (see apps/web/Dockerfile) and
// are absent from a plain `next dev` or a `docker build` that doesn't pass
// them. Absent is a first-class answer here — "unknown"/null, never a throw
// and never a 500. A health endpoint that can fail is not a health endpoint.
