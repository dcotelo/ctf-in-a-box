// The ai module's identity boundary. TWO signatures live here, and they are
// deliberately NOT the same kind of thing:
//
//   - The LAUNCH TOKEN is an EdDSA (Ed25519) JWS, signed with a MODULE-WIDE
//     private key the box alone holds. Its public half is publishable, so a
//     key-holding backend AND a pure static SPA can both VERIFY who is playing,
//     while neither can MINT. Identity is the one thing the box owns.
//   - The EVENT SIGNATURE is an HMAC over the request body, keyed by the
//     PER-CHALLENGE symmetric key from `ctf:ai:signkey`. It proves the sender is
//     the backend the organizer configured, and nothing else.
//
// They used to share one symmetric key, and that was a real hole: with an HMAC,
// verify-power IS mint-power. A backend holding the event key could mint a
// launch token naming any `sub`, and a caller that trusted `claims.sub` would
// award points to a user who never opened the challenge. Splitting the two —
// asymmetric for launch, symmetric for events — is what makes the threat note
// true: a leaked event key proves the sender and can invent nobody. See ADR 53.
//
// `verifyLaunchToken` NEVER reads the header's `alg` to pick an algorithm. It
// verifies Ed25519 or it fails, and it refuses a key that is not an Ed25519 key
// at all. Algorithm confusion is the exact class of bug this split exists to
// close, and re-introducing an `alg` switch would re-open it.
//
// Not `server-only`: this file is pure crypto over `node:crypto` with no store
// access, and the admin test route needs it. It must never import the store.
