// Explicit same-origin assertion for the app's own mutating API routes.
//
// WHAT THIS ADDS. Every custom route authenticates from the session cookie,
// and that cookie is `SameSite=Lax`, which already blocks the cross-site POST
// a CSRF attack needs. So this is defence in depth, not a fix for a live hole:
// today's protection is a better-auth default, held one dependency bump or one
// config edit away from changing under us. An explicit check keeps the
// property true for reasons this repo controls.
//
// Deliberately dependency-free — no `server-only`, no `next/*` — because
// `proxy.ts` imports it and that module's graph is kept to primitives that are
// safe outside a request scope (same discipline as `lib/gate.ts`).

/**
 * Whether a request may proceed, given its `Origin` header and the event's
 * configured URL.
 *
 * Two allow-cases are deliberate, and both are the standard reading rather
 * than a shortcut:
 *
 *   - **No `Origin` header** → allow. Browsers attach `Origin` to every
 *     cross-origin request that carries credentials, so its absence means a
 *     non-browser client (curl, a script, a health check) — which has no
 *     ambient cookie to ride in the first place, and so cannot mount the
 *     attack this defends against. Rejecting on absence would break ordinary
 *     tooling while adding no protection.
 *   - **No configured URL** → allow. With `BETTER_AUTH_URL` unset there is
 *     nothing to compare against; inventing an expectation from the request's
 *     own `Host` header would let an attacker satisfy the check by setting it.
 *     A gap that is honest beats one that looks like enforcement.
 *
 * Comparison is origin-to-origin (scheme + host + port), parsed rather than
 * string-compared, so a trailing slash or a path on the configured URL cannot
 * make a legitimate request fail.
