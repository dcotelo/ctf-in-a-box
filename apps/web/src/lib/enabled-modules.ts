 *  exact same failed-to-null) value.

/** Which modules this event is serving RIGHT NOW.
 *
 *  The stored set from `ctf:admin:settings` wins, including an explicitly
 *  empty one — an organizer who switched every board off meant it. Only when
 *  NOTHING is stored (`null`), or the read fails, does the default apply. The
 *  read fails **open** to that default: a Redis blip must render the modules
 *  this deployment was brought up for, never a surprise. Two load-bearing
 *  details, shared with `getResolvedModules`:
 *
 *  - `await connection()` (inside `getAdminSettingsSnapshot`) keeps the read
 *    out of the build-time prerender.
 *  - `cache()` dedupes WITHIN a request only; a toggle is live on the next.
 *
 *  Disabling a module writes nothing to its data — the toggle is a switch.
 *
 *  One narrowing happens after the stored-vs-default resolution either way:
 *  `secure-development` is dropped when this deployment has no scorer image.
 *  A stored set can carry it forward from before `SCORE_IMAGE` was unset —
 *  `updateAdminSettings` allows that (issue #386) so switching it back on
 *  needs no re-enable — but an unscoreable board is never SERVED. This
 *  narrowing is the reason `getResolvedModules` gets its live set from THIS
 *  function rather than reading `enabledModuleIds` off the settings snapshot
 *  directly: reading it raw would show secure-development's card on the
 *  landing page while `isModuleLive("secure-development")` answers false for
 *  the very same request (finding A's bug). */
