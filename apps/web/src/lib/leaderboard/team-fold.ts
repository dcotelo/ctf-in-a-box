/**
 * Folds one team's members' `HGETALL` replies into a single total, taking the
 * UNION of the items they hold — never the sum of their per-login aggregates.
 *
 * A team's total is the union because summing would double count any item two
 * teammates both earned, which is exactly the double-count bug the per-login
 * aggregate counters exist to avoid at the individual level. The aggregates
 * cannot serve a team either way: they are running totals with no memory of
 * WHICH items contributed to them, so there is nothing in them to dedupe by.
 *
 * The dedupe key is the hash FIELD name — the question id for quiz, the
 * challenge id for classic — and the record kept for a key more than one
 * member holds is the EARLIEST one. That earliest-wins rule is what makes a
 * team's banked score stable: a later solve/answer by a teammate, or a
 * since-changed item price recorded on someone else's row, must never change
 * what the team already earned.
 *
 * `points` is the sum over the deduped set, `completed` its size, and `lastAt`
 * the LATEST timestamp in it (most recent activity, for the "last activity"
 * column) — not the earliest one the dedupe keeps. Rows that fail to parse are
 * skipped, so one corrupt record costs its own item and nothing else.
 *
 * `memberReplies` is positional: entry `i` is member `i`'s reply, and an
 * `undefined` entry (a login the caller had no reply for) folds as empty.
