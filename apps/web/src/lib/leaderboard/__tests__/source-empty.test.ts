// The leaderboard source for an event with NO scored module.
//
// With `secure-development` disabled there is no scorer, no lambda and no
// Upstash scoring data for this event, so every configured source is wrong:
// mock would serve placeholder standings as if they were real, and
// lambda/upstash would read a backend that was never deployed. The board is
// built entirely by the module overlays instead, on top of an empty source.
//
// The registry is derived from the BAKED event config and the shipped
// event-config.generated.ts enables only secure-development, so a quiz-only
// fixture has to mock `@/lib/event-config`. `vi.mock` is hoisted per file, so
// the fixture lives in its own file — see modules-resolve.test.ts, and
// source.test.ts for the secure-development-enabled half of this behaviour.
