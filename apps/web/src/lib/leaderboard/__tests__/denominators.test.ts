// leaderboard team row, which could not reach the rule at all because it lived
// in `profile/module-blocks.ts`). Each time the numbers looked like this:
//
//     /leaderboard → AI Challenges   5 / 5 cleared     870 pts

// describe here is the real regression test: it drives BOTH forms from ONE
// fixture and asserts they land on the same denominator. A future surface that
// invents its own count fails here rather than becoming the fourth filing.
