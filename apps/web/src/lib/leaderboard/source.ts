 *                per-app solved/total, no per-challenge or point breakdown).
 *  - "upstash" — direct read of the CURRENT real Upstash schema (read-only
 *                token) — aggregates only, no teams, no per-app breakdown.
 *
 * An event with no scored module (`secure-development` disabled) ignores the
 * variable entirely and resolves to the "empty" mode — see
 * getLeaderboardSourceMode and ./empty.ts.
