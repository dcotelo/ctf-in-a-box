 * Component, so what it imports matters. Putting this in `admin-store.ts` made
 * it pull in the whole admin surface — and through it `modules.ts`, the module
 * registry, and `eventConfig.modules` — for a one-line SMEMBERS. That showed up
 * first as a test blowing up on an unrelated mock, which was the cheap warning;
 * the expensive version is an import cycle discovered later.
 *
 * The WRITE half stays in `admin-store.ts`, where the audit log and
 * `AdminValidationError` already live.
