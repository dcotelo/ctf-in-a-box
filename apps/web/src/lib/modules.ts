    // `evaluateGate`; it only ever refuses on paused/already-solved/cooldown,
    // never on a spent allowance, so never promise or imply one. There IS a
    // cooldown (`CLASSIC_COOLDOWN_SEC`, organizer-configurable in seconds via
    // `classicCooldownSec`). Every challenge carries a category and a point
    // value, and a solve count is shown (`challenge-board.tsx`'s tiles carry
    // the category heading and the "N pts" badge; `challenge-detail.tsx`'s
    // `ChallengeCard` carries the "N solve(s)" line on the challenge's own
    // page). Points are static — `SUBMIT_SCRIPT` reads the price off
    // the challenge hash at solve time and nothing anywhere lowers it as more
    // people solve. Nothing is graded for a signed-out visitor (`/flags`
    // renders a sign-in prompt instead of an input; `/api/classic/submit`

    // shipped (admin-ai-controls.tsx; hint-store.ts's ai target) and neither
    // needed this copy to change, since it never claimed they didn't exist.
    // Specifically checked against ai-store.ts, ai-token.ts and
    // ai-launch.ts, and the /api/ai routes:
    //
    //   - Each challenge is hosted on an EXTERNAL site (`AiChallenge.urlTemplate`).
    //     Opening it from `/ai/[id]` mints a fresh, PERSONAL launch token
    //     (`mintLaunchUrl`/`buildLaunchClaims`) naming the signed-in login in
    //     `sub` — nothing else on this box mints one.
    //   - `mode` is "event", "flag" or "both" (`AI_MODES`). An event-mode
    //     challenge reports its own solve back automatically, asserted by the
    //     external side against `/api/ai/event` (HMAC-signed, keyed by a
    //     per-challenge key the box alone issues); a flag/both challenge also
    //     takes a typed flag on the challenge page, graded instantly by
    //     `submitAiFlag` against a stored answer.
    //   - The launch token IS the identity carried onto the external site
    //     (`AiTokenClaims.sub`), and `/api/ai/submit` and `/api/ai/event` both
    //     act on `claims.sub` alone — cookie-blind, by design. Whoever holds a
    //     copy of the link plays and is rate-limited/cooled-down AS that login;
    //     there is no second check that the browser holding it is the one it
    //     was minted for. So: it is personal, sharing it lets someone else
    //     submit as you or spend your cooldown, and every point it earns still
    //     lands on your account regardless of who used it.
    //   - Solve timestamps are stamped by `runAward` by the box's own
    //     `new Date()` at award time — never a time the external side reports
    //     — so the box's clock decides when a solve happened, not the
    //     challenge's.
    //   - There is NO attempt cap in `evaluateGate`/`AWARD_SCRIPT`: it refuses
    //     only on paused/already-solved/cooldown, same as classic. There IS a
    //     cooldown (`AI_COOLDOWN_SEC`), applied to the GRADED path only — a
    //     signed event has no wrong answer to rate-limit (`awardAiEvent` passes
    //     cooldown 0). Hints and the admin control panel have since shipped
    //     (`admin-ai-controls.tsx`, `hint-store.ts`'s `ai` target) — nothing
    //     in this copy claims otherwise, so nothing here needed to change for
    //     that; this note just retires the "not yet" framing now that both are
    //     real.
