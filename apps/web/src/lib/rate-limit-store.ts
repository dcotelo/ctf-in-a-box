/**
 * Per-login fixed-window rate limiter for authenticated routes.
 *
 * KEYED ON THE LOGIN, not the IP, and that is the point. `lib/gate-store.ts`
 * throttles by IP because the gate runs before anyone has an identity — and it
 * documents that the key is spoofable, because Caddy appends to
 * `x-forwarded-for` rather than replacing it. These routes run *after*
 * `auth.api.getSession()`, so there is a session-backed login to key on that a
 * caller cannot forge without forging the session itself.
 *
 * Fixed window, not a sliding one: the thing being bounded is a burst (scripted
 * join-code guessing, a hammering client), and a fixed window costs one Lua
 * EVAL and one key. The known edge — up to 2× the limit across a window
 * boundary — is irrelevant at these budgets.
 *
 * FAILS OPEN. A Redis error lets the request through and logs. This is the
 * opposite of `consumeGateAttempt`, deliberately: that one guards a password
 * compare, where letting an unmetered guess through defeats the control.
 * These bound abuse of routes that have their own correctness gates
 * underneath (`joinTeam` validates the code; `revealHint` charges atomically
 * and is idempotent), so a Redis blip must not stop contestants playing. Same
 * fail-open reasoning the freeze reads use — see AGENTS.md.
