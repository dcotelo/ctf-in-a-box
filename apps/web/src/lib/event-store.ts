 *  to resurface if classic is later re-enabled. A module absent from the
 *  bundle ends up cleared but not re-imported — empty, matching the source.
 *  Refuses outright on a live event (see `EventLiveError`) — this must never
 *  run while contestants can still play.
 *
 *  Only `EVENT_POLICY_FIELDS` keys present in `bundle.settings` are applied

 *  are never in that allowlist (see event-io.ts's header) and so can never

 *  Development content is outside what a bundle can carry at all — that is
 *  reported back in `skipped` rather than silently dropped.
 *
 *  Fail-fast ordering: the settings patch is built and applied FIRST, right
 *  after the live-guard and before anything destructive. `updateAdminSettings`
 *  VALIDATES the patch and throws `AdminValidationError` on a bad one (e.g. an
 *  out-of-range `hintCost`/`teamMaxMembers`, or any other malformed scalar
 *  field — `enabledModuleIds` itself is already reconciled against this
 *  deployment's availability below, so it can't trigger that particular
 *  refusal) — applying it before `resetEvent`/clear/import means a
 *  malformed bundle is rejected with NOTHING destructive done yet, instead of
 *  failing after the board has already been wiped and half-replaced. The
 *  identity fields ride the same patch and so get the same guarantee.
 *  `resetEvent` is safe to run after: it keeps `ctf:admin:settings` (see its
 *  own doc comment in admin-store.ts) — it only freezes scoring and bumps the
 *  reset epoch — so it can never clobber the policy fields just written.
