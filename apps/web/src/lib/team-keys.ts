// Shared `ctf:user:*` / `ctf:team:*` / `ctf:joincode:*` key builders.
// Dependency-free ON PURPOSE — no imports at all — exactly like
// classic-keys.ts and quiz-keys.ts, and for the same reason: modules that
// must not pull in `team-store.ts` (which carries `server-only` and the whole
// Lua write surface) still need to name the keys.
//
// These lived as module-private consts in team-store.ts, which is why every
// other reader open-coded the strings instead: admin-store.ts's reset prefixes,
// and profile/page.tsx, whose comment admitted it. Open-coded key strings are
// how two readers of the same data drift apart, so the names live here now and
// team-store.ts imports them like every other reader — nothing re-exports them.
