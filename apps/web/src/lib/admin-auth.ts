 *  grants exist (issue #147; ADR 44 records the recovery path this set is

 * True when `login` is an admin — in `ADMIN_LOGINS` OR granted at runtime.

 * FAIL CLOSED, two ways. First, the ordinary one: a Redis error propagates
 * rather than resolving false-y by accident, and `requireAdmin` turns it
 * into a 403. This is deliberately the OPPOSITE of `effectivePaused`'s read
 * in admin-store, which fails OPEN so a Redis blip cannot drop live
 * submissions: that one is a safety switch whose failure should not stop an
 * event, and this one is an access check whose failure must not grant
 * access. Both behaviours are correct; they differ because the cost of
 * being wrong differs.
 *
 * Second, the config-v2-specific one: when `ADMIN_LOGINS` is EMPTY, nobody
 * is an admin, full stop — a runtime grant is refused too. The alternative
 * (empty allowlist = "no restriction configured, let runtime grants
 * decide") would make the panel reachable to whoever grants themselves
 * first, on a value that reads at a glance like "nobody"; refusing
 * everyone is the only answer this repo trusts to type correctly. This is
 * why the empty-set check happens BEFORE the Redis read, not after: it also
 * means the fail-closed path never touches Redis at all.
 *
 * An env admin short-circuits before Redis is touched, so the organizer can
 * still get in when the datastore is down — which is exactly when they most
 * need the panel.
