 * Quiz retry-gate defaults that BOTH the server and the admin UI need.

 * Same reason as `hint-defaults.ts`: `quiz-store.ts` is `server-only`, so the
 * admin panel — a Client Component — cannot import from it. When the panel
 * cannot see the default it renders an EMPTY box, and an empty box next to
 * help text reading "0 = unlimited" tells the organizer the opposite of the
 * truth.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: no `server-only`, no Redis, no env reads.
