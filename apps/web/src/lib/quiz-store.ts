/**
 * The quiz module. This file is the only place that touches `ctf:quiz:*`
 * Redis keys during normal contestant and authoring activity — answering,
 * grading, and question authoring/deletion all go through it, and nothing
 * else should read or write these keys for those flows. Two admin-store.ts
 * bulk-maintenance paths are the deliberate exception, reusing this file's
 * key constants/`canonicalizeChoices` (via quiz-keys.ts) rather than going
 * through these functions: `seedDemoData()` HSETs the questions/key/answers/
 * aggregate hashes directly when seeding demo data, and the master reset's
 * `scanDelByPrefix()` SCAN+DELs the per-login answers/attempts hashes and
 * the two aggregate hashes (never the questions/key hashes — those are
 * organizer content the reset keeps). See docs/architecture.md's "Quiz data
 * flow" for the full picture.
 *
 * Key layout:
 *   ctf:quiz:questions          hash, id -> JSON Question (public-safe; this
 *                                is what contestants see)
 *   ctf:quiz:key                hash, id -> JSON sorted array of correct
 *                                choice ids (SECRET from contestants — never
 *                                returned by any function a contestant-facing
 *                                route can call; readable by the admin-gated
 *                                `listQuestionsForAdmin` alone)
 *   ctf:quiz:answers:<login>    hash, id -> JSON {choices, points, at} —
 *                                records ONLY correct answers. Points are
 *                                captured at answer time, so a later
 *                                re-pricing of a question never rewrites
 *                                history.
 *   ctf:quiz:attempts:<login>   hash, id -> JSON {attempts, lastAt, lastAtMs}
 *                                — every attempt, right or wrong; Task 3's
 *                                retry gate reads this. `lastAtMs` (a plain
 *                                epoch-ms mirror of `lastAt`) exists only so
 *                                GRADE_SCRIPT can do cooldown arithmetic in
 *                                Lua without parsing an ISO-8601 string;
 *                                readers outside this file should use `lastAt`.
 *
 * Secrecy boundary — it is a CONTESTANT boundary, not an absolute one:
 * `ctf:quiz:key` mirrors how hint text lives in a scorer-owned hash the app
 * only ever reads, and how the scoring rubric stays private. Two readers,
 * deliberately kept apart:
 *
 *   - `listQuestions` (the CONTESTANT path — `/quiz`, the leaderboard
 *     overlay) never issues a command against `ctf:quiz:key`, and the
 *     `Question` type it returns has no field that could carry a
 *     correct-answer id. That property is absolute and must stay that way.
 *   - `listQuestionsForAdmin` (the ADMIN path — `GET /api/admin/quiz`, which
 *     is behind `requireAdmin`) DOES read the key, and returns it in a
 *     separate `AdminQuestion` shape that is deliberately not assignable to
 *     `Question` (see its doc comment). It exists because withholding the
 *     key from an organizer who is editing the question buys nothing —
 *     anyone through that gate can already delete the question, rewrite its
 *     answer, or reset the whole event — while costing real correctness: an
 *     edit form that starts with nothing marked correct makes every typo fix
 *     a chance to silently re-define what counts as right, with no diff and
 *     no warning.
 *
 * Grading (which also reads the key) is likewise server-only and never
 * exposed by a route that echoes its input back to the caller.
 *
 * The key ALWAYS stores a sorted JSON array of correct choice ids, even for
 * `"single"` questions (the one-element case) — so grading has one code
 * path for both question types, not two.
 *
 * Callers (the /api/quiz route handlers) are responsible for authenticating
 * the session and deriving `login` server-side — nothing here trusts
 * client-supplied identity.

 *  round trip, so two requests racing each other can both read "0 attempts
 *  spent" before either has written anything. It exists only to keep an

 *  the answer with its own distinct reason, "unavailable" — deliberately
 *  NOT "exhausted", because misreporting an unverifiable lookup as a real

 *  they have none left) turns a transient Redis blip into a support
 *  conversation about a wrong count. This is the OPPOSITE of the scoring
 *  freeze (`effectivePaused`), which fails OPEN so a Redis blip never drops
 *  a live submission — here, the safe failure is "no attempt", not "grade a
 *  possibly-replayed answer", but the caller must still be told the truth:
 *  the check couldn't be completed, not that they're out of attempts.

// Grades one submission and, on success, records everything it changes in a
// single atomic operation — mirroring hint-store.ts's REVEAL_SCRIPT, whose
// SADD-return-value idempotency guard is the pattern copied here as an
// HEXISTS guard. Unlike the JS-side `quizGate`/`evaluateGate` pre-check
// (which reads attempts/answers over its own separate, non-atomic round
// trip and so CANNOT by itself stop two — or fifteen — concurrent requests
// from all observing "0 attempts spent" before any of them writes), this
// script is the sole AUTHORITY on the attempt cap and cooldown: it re-reads
// attempts fresh at execution time, and Redis runs one script to completion
// before starting the next, so each concurrent submission sees every effect
// of every submission that finished before it. That's what actually closes
// the race — no amount of care in the pre-check could, since the pre-check
// and the script are necessarily two separate round trips.
//
//   1. HGET the secret answer key for this question. Missing -> {'missing'}:
//      there is nothing to grade (the caller passed a bad/deleted id).
//   2. HEXISTS on the per-login answers hash for this question, BEFORE any
//      write. A hit means `login` already banked a correct answer here (a
//      race that slipped past the gate's own read) -> {'already'}, with
//      nothing else touched.
//   3. Read the current {attempts,lastAt,lastAtMs} blob (plain string
//      matching, not a JSON library — the field format is one this module
//      fully controls) and, WITHOUT WRITING ANYTHING YET, re-check the cap
//      and cooldown against ARGV-supplied `maxAttempts`/`cooldownMs` (the
//      admin setting, resolved by the caller from the CURRENT config on
//      every call — never stored) and the freshly-read `attempts`/`lastAtMs`
//      (never a value the caller read earlier and handed in, which is what
//      would let a race bypass them):
//        - `attempts >= maxAttempts` (when capped) -> {'exhausted'}
//        - still within `lastAtMs + cooldownMs` (when cooled down) ->
//          {'cooldown', retryAtMs}
//   4. Only past both checks does a submission spend an attempt: bump the
//      count and HSET the new blob with `now`. This happens whether the
//      submission turns out right or wrong.
//   5. Compare the submitted sorted-JSON-array string against the stored
//      key, byte for byte (both sides are produced by the same
//      `[...ids].sort()` + `JSON.stringify` recipe — see `upsertQuestion`'s
//      dedupe-then-sort and `answerQuestion`'s dedupe-then-sort below, which
//      must keep agreeing for this comparison to mean anything — so equal
//      sets serialize identically regardless of submission order). Not
//      equal -> {'incorrect'}.
//   6. Equal: HGET the question's current `points` (read at grading time,
//      per spec, rather than trusting a value the caller might have fetched
//      earlier; `upsertQuestion` requires `points` to be a non-negative
//      integer so this match — and the HINCRBY below — can't be handed a
//      decimal mid-script with no way to roll back), HSET the answer row,
//      and HINCRBY the two aggregate counters (`ctf:quiz:points`,
//      `ctf:quiz:answered`) that the leaderboard overlay reads later ->
//      {'correct', points}.
//
// Both pattern matches are anchored with a trailing `[,}]` so a value can
// only match a complete `"field":<value>` pair immediately followed by the
// next field or the closing brace — not an arbitrary digit run that happens
// to appear earlier in the blob (e.g. inside a differently-ordered field).
