/**
 * The attempt-row shape, and the ONE parser for it.
 *
 * Quiz and classic each keep a per-login attempts hash (`ctf:quiz:attempts:<login>`,
 * `ctf:classic:attempts:<login>`) whose field is the item id and whose VALUE is
 * a JSON object written by their respective Lua scripts:
 *
 *     {"attempts":2,"firstAt":"<iso>","lastAt":"<iso>","lastAtMs":1234567890}
 *
 * That it is JSON — and not a bare count — is the whole reason this file
 * exists. The admin support tab summed these rows with `Number(value)`, which
 * on a JSON string is `NaN`, so its "Attempts" figure read **0 for every
 * contestant, always**. Nothing caught it: before the demo seed wrote attempt
 * rows at all, zero was the correct answer for seeded data, so the bug and the
 * empty fixture agreed with each other.
 *
 * Two readers now share this parser (metrics-store's per-challenge fold and
 * admin-ops-store's per-contestant lookup) precisely so a third cannot
 * reinvent `Number(value)` and be wrong in the same silent way.
