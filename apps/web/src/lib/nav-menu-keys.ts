// Pure, DOM-free decision logic for the header's "Challenges" dropdown
// (components/nav-dropdown.tsx), kept separate for the same reason
// lib/countdown.ts keeps getRemaining/formatCompact out of the component:
// this repo has no jsdom/@testing-library, so anything that needs a real
// focus() call or a real event object cannot be exercised in a test here.
// Extracting "given this key, what should happen" into ordinary functions
// makes the WAI-ARIA menu button's keyboard contract — Arrow movement with
// wraparound, Home/End, Escape-and-refocus, Tab-closes — testable directly,
// with the component left as a thin binding of these decisions to real DOM
// calls (focus(), setOpen, preventDefault).

 *  `null` — leaving the request parked — while the menu is still closed or
