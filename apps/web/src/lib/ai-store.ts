/**
 * The ai (externally hosted AI/LLM challenge) module. This file is the only
 * place that touches `ctf:ai:*` during normal contestant and authoring
 * activity. The one documented exception, as in classic: `admin-store.ts`'s
 * demo seed and master reset reuse the key names from `ai-keys.ts` directly.
 *
 * Secrecy boundary — a CONTESTANT boundary, with FOUR secret hashes rather
 * than classic's three, plus one secret string:
 *
 *   - `listAiChallenges` (CONTESTANT path) issues no command against
 *     `ctf:ai:flag`, `ctf:ai:flagnorm`, `ctf:ai:hints`, `ctf:ai:signkey` or
 *     `ctf:ai:launchkey`, and `AiChallenge` has no field any of them could ride
 *     in.
 *   - `listAiChallengesForAdmin` (behind `requireAdmin`) reads all four hashes
 *     and returns them in an `AdminAiChallenge` shape that is deliberately NOT
 *     assignable to `AiChallenge`, so handing an admin row to a
 *     contestant-facing component is a compile error rather than a leak.
 *   - `getAiSigningKey` is the ONE per-challenge key reader a route may call:
 *     one field of one hash. A route that needs a key must never reach for the
 *     admin lister instead — see that function's own docstring.
 *   - `getAiLaunchKeys` returns the module-wide launch keypair and is
 *     MINT-SIDE ONLY. A route that merely needs to VERIFY a token calls
 *     `getAiLaunchPublicKey`, which hands back the public half alone.
 *
 * `ctf:ai:launchkey`'s private half is the most dangerous secret in the module.
 * A flag lets its holder claim one solve; an event signing key lets its holder
 * assert solves on ONE challenge for players who already hold a box-minted
 * token; the launch PRIVATE key lets its holder mint identity itself, naming
 * any user on any challenge. Treat any code path that could carry it — or a
 * flag, or an event key — into a contestant payload as a critical bug.
