// Integration tests: exercises the REAL reveal Lua script against a live Redis
// (srh in CI, Upstash or srh locally), because that's where charge-once
// idempotency is actually enforced (atomically). Injects a run-unique field
// into hints:juice-shop, a run-unique solve into ctf:solves:juice-shop and
// uses a run-unique login; everything is cleaned up before and after.
//
// The reveal path reads the organizer's runtime settings (ctf:admin:settings,
// via resolveHintConfig/hintGate) before it ever reaches the script: hints
// on/off, the price, the anti-burner gate (solves on the target before its
// hints can be bought) and the unlock-after phase. This suite writes those
// four explicitly, through the store's own updateAdminSettings, so it pins
// what the reveal does under a KNOWN policy rather than whatever the previous
// run (or the admin-store suite, which writes hintCost 25) left behind — and
// then EARNS its way through the gate by seeding a solve, so the gate is
// exercised, not switched off. That is what rotted the previous version of
// this suite (#235): it seeded no solve and no settings, and every reveal was
// refused by the default one-solve gate.
//
// Gating comes from live-redis.ts: skipped without the env, a FAILURE when
// CTF_LUA_SUITES_REQUIRED is set. The suite shares ctf:admin:settings with
// the admin-store suite, so the live run is serial (see ci.yml).
