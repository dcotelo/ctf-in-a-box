// Pins the better-auth HTTP surface.
//
// better-auth mounts its ENTIRE default endpoint set behind the catch-all at
// app/api/auth/[...all], whether or not this app uses any of it. The one that
// mattered was POST /update-user: an arbitrary JSON body behind nothing but
// sessionMiddleware, run through parseUserInput (which accepts `login`,
// because that field must stay `input: true` for OAuth profile mapping to
// work), landing in a re-signed session cookie that IS the identity here
// because no `database` is configured. Any signed-in contestant could have
// become any other contestant and spent their points.
//
// The test that matters is the first one: it fails when a better-auth upgrade
// introduces a default endpoint nobody has classified. That is the failure
// mode a hand-written list of "paths we remembered to close" cannot catch.
