// Deployment-time check on BETTER_AUTH_URL (which docker-compose sets from
// EVENT_URL). Pure and dependency-free so it can be exhaustively tested
// without a server, a build, or an environment.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. better-auth derives the session cookie's `Secure` flag from
// the scheme of its baseURL. Ship an event on `http://ctf.example.org` and
// every session cookie — including an organizer's, whose login is in
// `event.yaml`'s `admins` — travels in cleartext on whatever conference wifi
// the contestants are sharing. This app has no server-side session store: the
// cookie IS the identity, so sniffing one is a full admin takeover, not a
// nuisance. The default in .env.example is `http://localhost`, which is
// correct for a local trial and catastrophic if an organizer edits the host
// and not the scheme — a one-token mistake with no visible symptom.
