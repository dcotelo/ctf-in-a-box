 *
 *  The raw string is what the event route HMACs. It must be the bytes that
 *  arrived: re-serializing the parsed object changes whitespace and key order,
 *  so every signature an external system computed would fail while looking
 *  like a wrong key. That is the single most expensive mistake available on
 *  this path, which is why the raw form is returned rather than left to the
 *  caller to re-read (a `Request` body can only be consumed once).
 *
 *  The cap is measured in BYTES and enforced WHILE READING, so an oversized
 *  body is never fully buffered, never parsed and never hashed.
 *
 *  That ordering matters more than it looks. This runs BEFORE the token check
 *  and before the rate limiter — it has to, since the token is IN the body —
 *  so it is the one thing on these routes an unauthenticated caller can reach
 *  at will. `request.text()` would buffer the whole payload before anyone
 *  looked at its size, and a handful of concurrent multi-megabyte POSTs from
 *  a stranger would then allocate up to the framework's own limit apiece with
 *  nothing here to stop them. Two cheaper gates instead:
 *
 *    1. a declared `Content-Length` over the cap is refused without the
 *       stream being touched at all;
 *    2. a body with no (or a lying) `Content-Length` is read chunk by chunk
 *       and abandoned — reader cancelled, buffers dropped — the moment the
 *       running total crosses the cap, so at most one chunk beyond it is ever
 *       held.
 *
 *  The decode is the spec's UTF-8 decode (`TextDecoder`, BOM-stripping,
 *  replacement on invalid sequences), which is exactly what `Request.text()`
 *  does — the returned `raw` must stay byte-for-byte what `text()` produced,
 *  because the event route HMACs it. */
