// Pure bundle parser, validator and serializer for the quiz's bulk
// import/export. Mirrors classic-io.ts, deliberately and closely: ADR 34
// settled what a content bundle is on this platform, and a second module
// inventing a second answer would leave organizers with two formats to learn
// and two validators to keep honest.
//
// This file is CLIENT-SAFE ON PURPOSE: the admin panel's bulk-import UI is a
// Client Component that needs to validate a pasted/uploaded bundle in the
// browser before it ever reaches the server, so this file must NEVER import
// quiz-store.ts (`server-only`) or anything that pulls in Upstash. It may only
// import from quiz-keys.ts, which is dependency-free for the same reason (see
// its header comment).
//
// Validation here MIRRORS `upsertQuestion` in quiz-store.ts and
// `parseQuestionPayload` in the admin route, field for field: a bundle that
// parses `ok: true` must contain only questions the single-question admin
// form would also have accepted, or the two authoring paths disagree about
// what is valid. If either of those changes, this must change with them.
//
// On top of that per-question mirror, a bundle carries two rules the
// single-question path has no equivalent for, because a bundle must be
// SELF-CONTAINED and is written by hand:
//
//   - No duplicate question ids within the file. A repeat would silently
//     overwrite the earlier question AND inherit every answer already
//     recorded against that id — never something to resolve with "last one
//     wins".
//   - No duplicate choice ids within one question. The admin form generates
//     choice ids and so cannot produce this, which is exactly why the store
//     never had to check: a hand-written file can. Two choices sharing an id
//     make the radio group ambiguous and make `correct` unable to name one of
//     them, so the question would be unanswerable in a way nothing downstream
//     reports.
//
// The quiz's retry-gate settings (`quizMaxAttempts`, `quizRetryAfterMin`) are
// deliberately NOT part of the bundle, matching classic's exclusion of
// `classicCooldownSec`. They are event policy rather than content, they are
// live-editable in /admin, and folding them in would mean importing a
// question set mid-event could silently re-open or shut a retry gate an
// organizer had already tuned — a change with no undo and no obvious cause.
