/**
 * The ONLY thing a store is allowed to hand `console.error` for a caught value.
 *
 * Never the caught value itself. The grading paths call `upstashEval` with the
 * submitted flag or answer — and, for classic, the stored flag's comparison
 * form — as ARGV, so a client or driver that decorates its errors with the
 * request it failed on (an attached `command`, `body` or `cause`, or a
 * serialized argument list) turns one `console.error(err)` into the event's
 * flags in the log. A rejected promise can also be an arbitrary value, not an
 * `Error` at all.
 *
 * So: name and message, both capped, and nothing else. No stack (it is the
 * part most likely to carry interpolated arguments), no own properties, and no
 * `String(err)` on a non-`Error` — a thrown string could BE the flag.
 *
 * Shared by `ai-store`, `classic-store` and `quiz-store` (#241, #244) so the
 * three cannot drift; `docs/reviewing.md`'s secrets-in-logs invariant is the
 * rule this implements.
