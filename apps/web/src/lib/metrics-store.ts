/**
 * Event engagement metrics (issue #169), computed ENTIRELY from data the box

 *
 * There is no collection step and no new write path. Every number below is a
 * read over keys the modules already maintain: quiz answers and classic solves
 * carry `{points, at}` per item per login, Secure Development solves are
 * timestamped in `ctf:solves:<target>`, attempts are counted per login, and
 * `firstTeamAt` (ADR 49) supplies the funnel's conversion moment.
 *
 * WHY NOT COLLECT FROM FORKS. A fork could report far more — pages opened,
 * time on a challenge, when someone gave up. It cannot report it *credibly*.
 * Authenticating a fork means a credential every contestant can read, so any
 * ingest endpoint is forgeable by every contestant, and engagement numbers
 * that a participant can inflate are worse than numbers that are merely
 * incomplete. ADR 46's rule for `/api/public/scoring` is the read-side of the
 * same boundary: that endpoint is read-only and policy-only, and metrics does
 * not touch it in either direction.
 *
 * COST. This is O(contestants) in round trips, batched. It is an on-demand
 * admin read — one per click, not one per page view — and deliberately not
 * cached, because an organizer refreshing it mid-event wants the current
 * number, not one from a minute ago.
