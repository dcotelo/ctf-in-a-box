# Hosting

Everything you need to stand the kit up: prerequisites, the poll-vs-push
choice, the GitHub OAuth app contestants sign in with, and how event config
reaches the app. For the happy-path command sequence see the
[README Quickstart](https://github.com/dcotelo/ctf-in-a-box#quickstart); for
running the event once it is up see [docs/operations.md](operations.md).

## Prerequisites

- Docker with Compose v2 (`docker compose version` must work).
- [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com), authenticated (`gh auth login`).
- A GitHub org for the event — one free org per event.
- `docker login ghcr.io` with a `write:packages` token. The `org` subcommand
  ends with `docker push ghcr.io/<org>/score:latest`, so it needs write access
  to your own org's packages.
- A scorer image named by `SCORE_IMAGE` in `.env`. There is no default, and
  `ctf-setup org` refuses to run until it is set.

Build your own scorer from the engine in `scorer/` — that is the
self-contained path and it needs no upstream access:

```sh
docker build -t ghcr.io/<your-org>/score:latest scorer/
```

The upstream image `ghcr.io/owasp-ctf/score` is private with no formal access
process; if the OWASP-CTF maintainers grant you access, point `SCORE_IMAGE` at
it instead. Either way `ctf-setup org` mirrors whatever `SCORE_IMAGE` names
into your event org so the forks' Actions can pull it. Authoring a rubric and
building the image is covered in [docs/scorer.md](scorer.md).

## Poll vs push

Scores travel from the scoring Action back to your box one of two ways.
**`SCORE_INGEST` in `.env` is the operative switch** — it is what
`docker-compose.yml` and the Caddy profile actually read.
`modules.secure-development.score_ingest` in `event.yaml` documents the same
choice for readers; nothing syncs the two, so keep them matching.

| Mode | How it works | Requirements | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| `poll` (default) | The `sync` service polls the org's target repos for score comments using your organizer PAT | Nothing extra — works behind NAT, on a laptop, anywhere | ~30 s |
| `push` | The scoring Action POSTs the score directly to your box | A public URL; `SCORE_INGEST=push` and org Actions secrets `LEADERBOARD_URL` / `LEADERBOARD_TOKEN` | Near-instant |

Poll mode is what `scripts/smoke.sh` proves working today. Push mode
additionally depends on upstream item 2 in
[Status and upstream dependencies](operations.md#status-and-upstream-dependencies)
actually shipping, and Caddy only exposes the `/score` route externally when
running with the `push` Caddyfile.

Start the poll pipeline with `docker compose --profile poll --profile app up
-d` — the `poll` profile brings up `sync`, and `app` brings up the
contestant-facing app. Push mode does not need `sync` running.

## GitHub OAuth app

Contestants sign in with GitHub, so you need an OAuth app:

1. In the event org (or your personal account), create a new OAuth app.
2. Set the callback URL to `<EVENT_URL>/api/auth/callback/github`, where
   `EVENT_URL` is the value in `.env` — that is what Caddy and the app's auth
   flow use. (`event.yaml`'s `event.url` is a separate, unsynced field.)
3. Put the client ID in `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and the secret in
   `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`.

## Configuration

`event.yaml` uses a **modules** schema. Platform settings (`event`, `github`,
`teams`, `hints`, `admins`) sit at the top level; challenge content is
namespaced under `modules.<name>`. v1 ships exactly one module,
`modules.secure-development`, holding the target list and `score_ingest`.

Copy `event.yaml.example` and fill in `github.org`,
`modules.secure-development.targets`, `admins` (GitHub logins), and
`event.url`. Team play is configured at the top level — `teams: { enabled:
true, max_size: 4 }` in `event.yaml.example`. What a module must provide to
plug in — config block, scoring contract, transports, security requirements,
provisioning — is documented in [docs/modules.md](modules.md).

### Rebuilding the app after a config change

The contestant app (`apps/web/`, vendored — see
[`apps/web/VENDORED.md`](https://github.com/dcotelo/ctf-in-a-box/blob/main/apps/web/VENDORED.md))
bakes its event name, dates, URL, enabled-target list, fork org and optional
Discord link from `event.yaml` at **image-build time**, via the
`EVENT_CONFIG_B64` build arg. The fork org also drives every "fork this repo"
link the app renders, so contestants are pointed at the org `ctf-setup org`
actually forked into.

Compose only rebuilds an image when told to, so `up -d` alone will not pick up
an `event.yaml` edit:

```sh
EVENT_CONFIG_B64=$(base64 < event.yaml | tr -d '\n') docker compose --profile app build app
docker compose --profile poll --profile app up -d
```

Building without `EVENT_CONFIG_B64` falls back to the neutral "OWASP CTF"
defaults. See `apps/web/scripts/generate-event-config.mjs` for the full
`EVENT_CONFIG` yaml > `EVENT_*` env var > default precedence, and
[docs/architecture.md](architecture.md#build-time-config-flow) for the whole
build-time config flow.
