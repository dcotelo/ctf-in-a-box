# Hosting

Everything you need to stand the kit up: prerequisites, the poll-vs-push
choice, the GitHub OAuth app contestants sign in with, and how event config
reaches the app. For the happy-path command sequence see the
[README Quickstart](https://github.com/dcotelo/owasp-ctf#quickstart); for
running the event once it is up see [docs/operations.md](operations.md).

## Quickstart: zero to a scored event

**The fastest path is the wizard** — run `ctf-setup.sh` with no subcommand and
it walks the whole sequence below. It **asks for each value inline** — your box
URL, the event org, the admin logins, whether you run **Secure Development**,
and the App/OAuth credentials — showing the instructions and GitHub URL for
each, and writing `.env` for you as you answer. There is no config file to
edit between steps: `.env` is the whole bootstrap plane, and everything else
(the event's name and dates, **which modules run**, which Secure Development
targets) is a runtime `/admin` setting. It does every automatable step,
guides + verifies each UI-only one, and resumes if you stop:

```sh
./setup/ctf-setup.sh            # guided, prompts for values, resumable
```

Every discrete step is also its own subcommand — `check`, `secrets`, `org`,
`render`, `upgrade`, `teardown`, `doctor`, `app-manifest`, `app-config`,
`oauth-app`, `oauth-config` — with the global flags `--dry-run` (print
mutating commands instead of running them) and `--out <path>` (default
`.env`, the file every subcommand reads and `secrets` writes). The numbered
sequence below names each one where it's used; `teardown` is covered in
[operations.md](operations.md#running-an-event).

![The guided setup wizard in a terminal: an ASCII banner, then numbered steps — a resumed run, where the secrets, event config and scorer image already in place are ticked off and the wizard continues from the first step still to do](assets/wizard.jpg)

<sup>The wizard on a resumed run: every step already done is ticked and
skipped, and it continues from the first one still to do. On a first run each
of those values is asked for inline, with the GitHub page it comes from.</sup>

**Step 3, "Event basics", is the whole of what the wizard writes.** Three
keys into `.env`, in this order:

- **`GITHUB_ORG`** — the disposable per-event org. Blank is allowed for an
  event that runs no forked content.
- **`ADMIN_LOGINS`** — comma-separated GitHub logins allowed into `/admin`.
  It defaults to the login running the wizard (`gh api user`), so Enter
  accepts. **An empty answer is refused**, not written: an empty
  `ADMIN_LOGINS` makes `/admin` forbid *everyone*, and that failure is silent
  until somebody tries to open the panel.
- **`SCORE_IMAGE`**, from one question — *"Run Secure Development (fork the
  six targets and score patch PRs)?"*. Yes writes the scorer image reference
  (your existing one, else `ghcr.io/<org>/score:latest`); no writes it empty.
  **Non-empty is the switch**: it is what says this event runs Secure
  Development at all. Saying yes with no org is refused, since there would be
  nothing to fork into.

Say yes and it also asks **`SCORE_INGEST` (poll | push)**, re-asking until the
answer is exactly one of the two — it becomes a Caddyfile path in compose, so
a typo is a failed bring-up rather than a wrong label. `EVENT_URL` is asked
once: at step 2 when the wizard creates `.env`, or at step 3 when an existing
file has no value for it.

**Secure Development decides which later steps run.** With `SCORE_IMAGE` set,
steps 4–7 do the scorer image, the `sync` GitHub App, and the org: forks,
scoring workflows and the package-grant checklist. With it empty each of
those prints `⏭  not needed` and the run goes straight to the bring-up — no
scorer image to build, no App to install, no org to create, and a `docker
compose --profile app` command with no score-ingest profile. Step 6, the
sign-in OAuth app, always runs: every event needs sign-in. With no event org
it points you at GitHub's personal new-OAuth-App page instead of the org's.

The wizard never asks which targets to run: `ctf-setup.sh org` forks and
provisions all six of `setup/targets.tsv` for every event that runs Secure
Development, and which of the six contestants actually see is chosen
afterward from `/admin` → Secure Development → Targets, live, with no
rebuild — see [docs/operations.md](operations.md#targets).

**Everything else is a runtime setting, so the wizard does not ask for it.**
Which modules run, the event's name, tagline, location, contact and Discord
invite, the scoring window and dates, hint policy, team caps, the quiz's
attempt and cooldown knobs: all of them live in `ctf:admin:settings` and are
changed from `/admin` while the event is up (config v2, #386). There is no
config file to write or re-bake, and the only "module" question at setup time
is the Secure Development one above, because that module is the only one with
containers and forks to provision.

A resumed run re-reads `.env` and ticks off what is answered rather than
re-asking it, and says which way the Secure Development switch is set — plus,
when it is off, that setting `SCORE_IMAGE` is how you turn it on. The one
exception is a hand-rolled `.env` with no `SCORE_IMAGE` line at all: that
question has never been put, so the wizard asks step 3 again rather than
assuming an answer.

The rest of this section is the same sequence as explicit commands, for when
you'd rather drive it yourself or script it. Each step is either a
`ctf-setup.sh` command or a **UI-only** step GitHub forces you through by hand
(marked below); `ctf-setup.sh` never mints credentials or creates orgs for you.

```sh
# 0. Verify tooling: gh auth, docker, docker compose v2, openssl.
./setup/ctf-setup.sh check

# 1. Clone the repo and work from its root.
git clone https://github.com/dcotelo/owasp-ctf && cd owasp-ctf

# 2. Generate .env — BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, SRH_TOKEN, SCORER_TOKEN, REDIS_PASSWORD,
#    EVENT_URL, SCORE_INGEST=poll, and empty App/OAuth/SCORE_IMAGE fields to fill later.
./setup/ctf-setup.sh secrets

# 3. Build + push the scorer image, then set SCORE_IMAGE in .env by hand.
#    Pin linux/amd64 — GitHub runners are amd64; an arm64 image (the default on
#    Apple Silicon) fails scoring with "no matching manifest for linux/amd64".
docker login ghcr.io   # token with write:packages
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t ghcr.io/<your-org>/score:latest --push scorer/
#    MANUAL: edit SCORE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/<your-org>/score:latest in .env
#    (the wizard builds + pins amd64 for you at step 4)

# 4. Fill in the two bootstrap identities in .env, by hand or with the wizard.
#    MANUAL edit: GITHUB_ORG=<your event org>, ADMIN_LOGINS=<your login>.
#    Both are read at RUNTIME with no baked default: an empty ADMIN_LOGINS
#    403s everyone at /admin, and an empty GITHUB_ORG leaves the poller
#    refusing to start. The event's name and dates, which modules run and
#    which Secure Development targets run are all /admin settings — see
#    step 10 below.

# 5. Create the disposable GitHub org — UI-ONLY, ctf-setup never creates it:
#    https://github.com/account/organizations/new
```

```sh
# 6. Sync GitHub App (poll auth). Opens a pre-filled creation form:
./setup/ctf-setup.sh app-manifest
#    UI-ONLY: Create App → Generate a private key (.pem) → note the App ID →
#    Install App on the event org. Then wire the key + App ID into .env:
./setup/ctf-setup.sh app-config --app-id <id> --pem ~/Downloads/<app>.private-key.pem
#    Add --installation-id <n> to pin the install; otherwise sync
#    auto-discovers it at runtime.

# 7. Sign-in OAuth app (separate from the App above). Opens the page and
#    prints the exact field values:
./setup/ctf-setup.sh oauth-app
#    UI-ONLY: fill the fields with callback <EVENT_URL>/api/auth/callback/github
#    → Register → Generate a client secret → copy Client ID + secret. Then:
./setup/ctf-setup.sh oauth-config --client-id <client id>
#    The secret is read from a hidden prompt — never on the command line.

# 8. Provision the event org. Dry-run first, then for real:
./setup/ctf-setup.sh org --dry-run
./setup/ctf-setup.sh org
#    org forks the targets, creates + protects the `ctf` branch, COMMITS
#    ctf-score.yml to each fork, disables inherited workflows, and mirrors
#    SCORE_IMAGE into the org's GHCR. Finish the UI-ONLY steps it prints:
#      (a) detach each fork from its fork network (Settings → Leave fork
#          network);
#      (b) keep ghcr.io/<org>/score PRIVATE and grant each fork Read under the
#          package's Manage Actions access;
#      (c) push mode only: org Actions secrets LEADERBOARD_URL / LEADERBOARD_TOKEN.
#    Then verify provisioning:
./setup/ctf-setup.sh doctor
```

```sh
# 9. Bring the containers up. Everything the containers need is in .env —
#    there is no config file to bake in. The profiles follow SCORE_IMAGE —
#    see "Which profiles do I need?" below; this is the secure-development
#    line-up.
docker compose --profile secdev --profile app up -d --build

# 10. Verify: watch the poller heartbeat, open the app, sign in, hit /admin.
docker compose logs -f sync
#     Open $EVENT_URL, sign in with GitHub, confirm /admin loads for an admin login.
```

## Prerequisites

Every event needs:

- Docker with Compose v2 (`docker compose version` must work).
- [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com), authenticated (`gh auth login`) —
  `ctf-setup.sh check` requires it whatever the module mix.
- `openssl` — `ctf-setup.sh check` requires it (used for secret generation).

Only an event that runs **Secure Development** (`SCORE_IMAGE` set in `.env`)
also needs:

- A GitHub org for the event — one free org per event. It becomes
  `GITHUB_ORG`: the org the forks live in and the poller reads.
- `docker login ghcr.io` with a `write:packages` token. The `org` subcommand
  ends with `docker push ghcr.io/<org>/score:latest`, so it needs write access
  to your own org's packages.
- A scorer image named by `SCORE_IMAGE`. There is no default: with it empty,
  `ctf-setup org` says so and skips every fork/mirror/poll step (exit 0 — an
  app-only event provisions nothing on GitHub and needs no org at all). Set it
  and the same command provisions all six targets of `setup/targets.tsv`;
  `/admin` then picks the subset contestants see.

Build your own scorer from the engine in `scorer/` — that is the
self-contained path and it needs no upstream access:

```sh
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t ghcr.io/<your-org>/score:latest --push scorer/
```

(`--platform linux/amd64` is required — GitHub runners are amd64, and
`ctf-setup org`'s mirror step refuses a non-amd64 image.)

The upstream image `ghcr.io/owasp-ctf/score` is private with no formal access
process; if the OWASP-CTF maintainers grant you access, point `SCORE_IMAGE` at
it instead. Either way `ctf-setup org` mirrors whatever `SCORE_IMAGE` names
into your event org so the forks' Actions can pull it. Authoring a rubric and
building the image is covered in [docs/scorer.md](scorer.md).

## Fork setup and the contest flow

Each target is a specific **upstream** app pinned to a source ref — that pin is
the source of truth (there is no middle-man fork). The scorer judges a fork of it
with the vendored rubric, and the *scoring baseline* image is the stock, unpatched
build that [`stock-scores-zero`](operations.md#verifying-it-works) proves scores
`0 / N`:

> The per-target upstream repo and pinned ref below are sourced from
> [`setup/targets.tsv`](https://github.com/dcotelo/owasp-ctf/blob/main/setup/targets.tsv),
> which `ctf-setup org` reads to fork each target. Keep this table in sync with that file.

| Target | Upstream repo | Source ref | Scoring baseline (pinned image) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `juice-shop` | `juice-shop/juice-shop` | tag `v20.0.0` | `bkimminich/juice-shop:v20.0.0` |
| `webgoat` | `WebGoat/WebGoat` | tag `v2025.3` | `webgoat/webgoat:v2025.3` |
| `vulnerableapp` | `SasanLabs/VulnerableApp` | tag `2.1.37` (commit `bad68b1`) | `sasanlabs/owasp-vulnerableapp:2.1.37` |
| `securityshepherd` | `OWASP/SecurityShepherd` | commit `662771b` | self-build (no stock image) |
| `dvwa` | `digininja/DVWA` | commit `d45ba3c` | `ghcr.io/digininja/dvwa@sha256:091498ce…` |
| `vampi` | `erev0s/VAmPI` | commit `f16052d` | `erev0s/vampi@sha256:0a5a224b…` |

`ctf-setup.sh org` forks each target into your event org, commits the scoring
workflow (`.github/workflows/ctf-score.yml`) to each fork's `ctf` branch, and
mirrors your `SCORE_IMAGE` into the org's GHCR. (The separate `render`
subcommand writes the workflows to `dist/workflows/` for offline inspection
without committing.) It automates the whole per-fork setup, is idempotent (safe to
re-run — each step is skipped once already satisfied), and leaves only three
GitHub-UI-only steps for you to finish by hand. Run `ctf-setup.sh doctor`
afterward: it prints a **status matrix** (one row per target, one column per
step) so the whole org's provisioning is scannable at a glance, then reports
each fork's **scoring-workflow version** (see
[Upgrading the scoring workflow](#upgrading-the-scoring-workflow)) and each
fork's **package Read grant**, the one step with no API in either direction.

It also checks the three bootstrap facts that have no other alarm:
**`ADMIN_LOGINS` is non-empty** (empty 403s everyone at `/admin`),
**`GITHUB_ORG` is set and matches the org being inspected** (a warning
instead of a failure when Secure Development is off, since an app-only event
has no org), and **the `sync` GitHub App is installed on the org**, by App
id — failing closed, so a `gh` error without `admin:org` scope reports "not
verified" rather than "installed". See
[docs/operations.md](operations.md#the-org-and-the-bootstrap-keys-ctf-setupsh-doctor).

![ctf-setup.sh doctor status matrix: one row per fork, one column per step](assets/doctor.jpg)

**Automated by `ctf-setup org`** (one pass per target):

1. **Fork** the target from its pinned upstream repo/ref into your event org.
2. **Create and default the `ctf` branch** at that pinned ref (and drop the
   fork's old `master`/`main` default branch).
3. **Protect the `ctf` branch** so a contestant can never merge their patch —
   the PR is *scored, not merged*. It installs a minimal rule requiring one
   approving review:

   ```sh
   gh api -X PUT repos/<org>/<repo>/branches/ctf/protection --input - <<'JSON'
   { "required_status_checks": null, "enforce_admins": false,
     "required_pull_request_reviews": { "required_approving_review_count": 1 },
     "restrictions": null, "allow_force_pushes": false, "allow_deletions": false }
   JSON
   ```

4. **Install the scoring workflow**: renders and commits
   `.github/workflows/ctf-score.yml` on the `ctf` branch from the in-repo
   template.
5. **Disable the fork's inherited/upstream workflows** (everything except
   `ctf-score.yml`), so only the scoring Action runs.
6. **Install the PR template** (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) on the
   `ctf` branch.
7. **`vulnerableapp` only** — install the Dockerfile it needs to build.
8. **Mirror `SCORE_IMAGE`** into the org's GHCR (once, after all targets),
   refusing a non-amd64 image so scoring can't fail at runtime — GitHub
   runners are amd64; an arm64-only image (e.g. built on Apple Silicon) makes
   the scoring Action fail with `no matching manifest for linux/amd64`.

**Manual — GitHub UI only, no API to perform them.** GitHub has no endpoint to
*do* these, but `doctor` confirms the first two by API (their result is
queryable) and shows ✅ once done — only the third is a blind reminder:

1. **Create the event org** itself.
2. **Detach each fork from the fork network** (repo Settings → *Leave fork
   network*, UI-only). This makes the event-org repo a standalone root, so
   contestant PRs default to *your* repo (not upstream) and contestants can
   fork it themselves. `doctor` verifies via the repo's `.fork` flag (✅
   detached / ⚠️ still a fork).
3. **Keep the `ghcr.io/<org>/score` package private** and **grant each fork
   Read** under the package's *Manage Actions access* (container visibility is
   UI-only). The rendered workflow logs in to GHCR with the runner
   `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which the Read grant makes sufficient. `doctor` verifies the
   package is private via its `.visibility`.

   The per-fork grant has no read endpoint, so `doctor` verifies it **by
   observation** instead: the rendered workflow pulls the scorer image in its
   own step (`Pull scorer image`), and `doctor` reads each fork's recent
   scoring runs for that step's outcome — ✅ *granted* (a run pulled it),
   ❌ *MISSING* (a run was refused), or ⚠️ *unverified* (no run has reached
   the pull yet). It fails closed: an API error, or anything it cannot read,
   reports unverified, never granted.

   This is the only provisioning step with no API, and it used to be the only
   one whose failure looked like something else — an unpulled image failed
   inside the scorer step and posted "Scoring did not complete" to the
   contestant's PR, so the contestant re-pushed a patch that was never judged
   while the organizer had no reason to look at the package settings. The
   workflow now names the cause in the run's step summary and in the PR
   comment, and says plainly that it is a setup problem rather than a verdict
   on the submission.

   **Already-provisioned forks keep the old workflow** until it is re-applied
   — see [Upgrading the scoring workflow](#upgrading-the-scoring-workflow)
   below. A fork still on the old one has no `Pull scorer image` step, so
   `doctor` reports it as ⚠️ unverified — correctly: it has not been observed
   either way.

   Note that this includes forks that have **scored successfully many times**.
   Under the old workflow the pull happened inside `Run scorer`, where it
   cannot be read back separately, so a working grant is invisible to
   `doctor` until that fork runs the upgraded workflow once. ⚠️ here means *not
   observed*, never *not granted*. Re-triggering any existing PR on an
   upgraded fork (close, reopen) is enough to settle it.

### Upgrading an event that predates the Redis password

Redis runs with `requirepass`, and `docker-compose.yml` reads that password
from `REDIS_PASSWORD` with `:?` — so an `.env` written before this change
**does not start a weaker stack, it does not start at all**:

```
error while interpolating services.srh.environment.SRH_CONNECTION_STRING:
required variable REDIS_PASSWORD is missing a value: set REDIS_PASSWORD in
.env (setup/ctf-setup.sh secrets generates one; see docs/hosting.md)
```

(It names `srh` rather than `redis` only because that is the first place
compose resolves the variable — both services need it.)

That is deliberate. A security control whose variable can go missing and
leave the control silently off is the failure this change exists to remove.
`doctor` flags it before you get there, with a generated value to paste. To
fix it by hand, add one line to `.env` and bring the stack back up:

```sh
echo "REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)" >> .env
docker compose --profile secdev --profile app up -d   # SCORE_IMAGE set
docker compose --profile app up -d                    # SCORE_IMAGE empty
```

Pick the line that matches your `.env`: `--profile secdev` is added **iff
`SCORE_IMAGE` is non-empty**, and a quiz-, Classic- or AI-only event has no
scorer image to pull. (Passing `--profile secdev` without one fails at `up`,
trying to pull the private upstream fallback.)

Nothing else changes: no data migration, and the `redis-data` volume is
untouched. Only `redis` itself (its `requirepass`) and `srh` (its connection
string) are given the password, and only `srh` can reach Redis — `app`,
`scorer` and `sync` never see it and sit on a separate compose network with no
route to `redis:6379` at all.

If you drive Redis by hand (`docker compose exec redis redis-cli ...`), that
keeps working unchanged: the service sets `REDISCLI_AUTH`, so `redis-cli`
authenticates itself inside the container.

### Upgrading the scoring workflow

The scoring workflow lives in each fork as a committed file, so a change to
the kit's template does **not** reach an event that is already provisioned.
That matters most for the changes you least want stranded — a security fix to
`ctf-score.yml` would otherwise only reach forks by hand, one at a time.

The rendered workflow carries a version stamp copied from the template:

```
# ctf-workflow-version: 3
```

`doctor` reports every fork's version against the kit's, and names the fix
(sample output — the current template version is whatever the stamp above
says in your checkout):

```
scoring workflow version (template is v3):
  juice-shop         ✅ v3
  dvwa               ❌ v2 — stale (template v3); run: ./setup/ctf-setup.sh upgrade
  webgoat            ❌ pre-versioning — provisioned before workflow stamping; run: ./setup/ctf-setup.sh upgrade
```

Then re-apply it to exactly the forks that are behind:

```sh
./setup/ctf-setup.sh upgrade --dry-run   # see which forks would be touched
./setup/ctf-setup.sh upgrade
```

`upgrade` does the workflow step and nothing else. `org` does it too — its
workflow step compares versions rather than just checking the file exists —
but `org` also re-mirrors the scorer image, which is a multi-minute push you
do not want between you and a security fix.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Open PRs keep their current run.** The new workflow applies from each PR's
  next push (or a manual re-run), so a mid-event upgrade rolls out as
  contestants push rather than all at once.
- **A fork ahead of your checkout is left alone.** `doctor` flags it ⚠️ and
  `upgrade` skips it — that means your kit is behind, not the fork, and
  overwriting would silently revert whatever it is running.

Pre-versioning forks (anything provisioned before the stamp existed) read as
stale and are upgraded the same way.

**The contest flow:** a contestant **forks your event-org repo** into their own
account, patches the vulnerability, and opens a **pull request against
`<event-org>/<repo>:ctf`**. The scoring Action (`pull_request_target`, so a
cross-fork PR gets a writable token to comment) runs the scorer and posts the
score comment; the PR is never merged. Detaching the fork network (manual step
2 above) is what makes this fork-then-PR-back flow work.

## Poll vs push

Scores travel from the scoring Action back to your box one of two ways.
**`SCORE_INGEST` in `.env` is the switch, and since #386 it is the only copy
of it** — it is what `docker-compose.yml` and the Caddy profile read, what
the wizard's "Score ingest" answer writes, and what the wizard's bring-up
step reads to choose the compose profile. There is no second declaration
anywhere to drift out of step with it (there used to be one in the deleted
event config file, and it did: #372).

| Mode | How it works | Requirements | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| `poll` (default) | The `sync` service polls the org's target repos for score comments | a GitHub App installed on the event org (see below) — otherwise nothing extra; works behind NAT, on a laptop, anywhere | ~30 s |
| `push` | The scoring Action POSTs the score directly to your box | A public URL; `SCORE_INGEST=push` and org Actions secrets `LEADERBOARD_URL` / `LEADERBOARD_TOKEN` | Near-instant |

Poll mode is what `scripts/smoke.sh` proves working today. Push mode's
requirements ship in-kit — the scoring workflow reads the
`LEADERBOARD_URL`/`LEADERBOARD_TOKEN` org secrets and the scorer's
`POST /score` takes bearer auth (see
[Status and upstream dependencies](operations.md#status-and-upstream-dependencies))
— and Caddy only exposes the `/score` route externally when running with the
`push` Caddyfile.

Start the poll pipeline with `docker compose --profile secdev --profile app up
-d` — the `secdev` profile brings up `sync` and the `scorer`, and `app` brings
up the contestant-facing app. Push mode does not need `sync` running, so it
uses `--profile push --profile app` instead (the `push` profile carries the
scorer without the poller).

### Which profiles do I need?

Compose profiles follow **`SCORE_IMAGE`**, not your taste: `app` is always
on, and Secure Development's own profile — `secdev`, or `push` if that is the
`SCORE_INGEST` you set — carries everything `secure-development` needs. The
`scorer` is part of that module (it exists to score PRs against forked
targets), so it carries both — `["secdev", "push"]` — while `sync` carries
`["secdev"]` alone, since push mode has the fork's Action POST to the scorer
directly and needs no poller. A quiz-only event must not be asked to pull a
scorer image it has no reason to own.

**Profiles and `SCORE_IMAGE` are two separate choices that have to agree, not
one setting picking both.** You choose the profile at `up`: `--profile app`
alone for a quiz/classic/ai-only event; with Secure Development,
`--profile secdev --profile app` when `SCORE_INGEST` is `poll` (or unset) and
`--profile push --profile app` when it is `push` — the `push` profile is what
mounts the Caddyfile with the `/score` route. Either Secure Development
profile needs an *accessible* `SCORE_IMAGE` — the compose fallback image is
private, so bringing one up without your own `SCORE_IMAGE` set fails the
pull. Separately, the app's
DEFAULT module set (what an organizer sees on first opening `/admin`, and
the outage fallback) follows `SCORE_IMAGE` on its own: Secure Development
alone when it is set, nothing when it is not — Quiz, Classic and AI are
switched on from the panel (#386). Nothing enforces that the two agree, so
keep them in sync yourself: never bring the `secdev` profile up without a
`SCORE_IMAGE`, or the scorer container has nothing to score against.

Nothing is baked into the images any more (#386): `--build` only rebuilds
the code, and every value the containers need — `ADMIN_LOGINS`,
`GITHUB_ORG`, `SCORE_IMAGE`, `SCORE_INGEST` — is read from `.env` when they
start. Pick the command by what that file says:

| Your event | Command |
|---|---|
| Secure Development in poll mode (`SCORE_IMAGE` set, `SCORE_INGEST=poll`) | `docker compose --profile secdev --profile app up -d --build` |
| Secure Development in push mode (`SCORE_IMAGE` set, `SCORE_INGEST=push`) | `SCORE_INGEST=push docker compose --profile push --profile app up -d --build` |
| No Secure Development (`SCORE_IMAGE` empty) — quiz and/or classic and/or ai | `docker compose --profile app up -d --build` |

Quiz, Classic and AI need no profile of their own: they are app-side modules,
they run inside the `app` container, and an organizer switches them on from
`/admin` at any time without touching compose. `ctf-setup.sh wizard` prints
(and offers to run) the right line for the `.env` you answered into, so you do
not have to pick by hand.

Prefer the cloud over your own machine? [Deploy on AWS](aws.md) ships a
Terraform module for an ECS Fargate stack behind an ALB, over managed
ElastiCache — `terraform apply` up, `terraform destroy` down. It replaced a
single-EC2 deploy, so an existing box upgrades by migration rather than by
`apply`.

### Poll auth: GitHub App

`sync` needs a token to read the event org's target repos, and a GitHub App
is the only supported poll auth: org-scoped, auto-expiring, revocable, and not
tied to a person. Each organizer creates their **own** App from
[`sync/app-manifest.json`](https://github.com/dcotelo/owasp-ctf/blob/main/sync/app-manifest.json)
and installs it on their event org — there is no shared, central App, so the
private key stays yours.

`ctf-setup.sh` assists the two error-prone parts; you still click Create and
Install in GitHub's UI (the script cannot mint credentials for you):

```bash
# 1. Open a pre-filled App-creation form against your event org.
ctf-setup.sh app-manifest
#    In the browser: Create the App, "Generate a private key" (downloads a
#    .pem), note the App ID, then "Install App" on the event org.

# 2. Wire the downloaded key + App ID into .env (base64-encodes the PEM).
ctf-setup.sh app-config --app-id <id> --pem ~/Downloads/<app>.private-key.pem
#    Add --installation-id <n> to pin the install; otherwise sync
#    auto-discovers it at runtime.
```

This sets `GITHUB_APP_ID` / `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (base64-encoded PEM) and,
optionally, `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` in `.env`. Both `GITHUB_APP_ID` and
`GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` are required — `sync` refuses to start without them.
You can also set all three by hand instead of using the helpers.

## GitHub OAuth app

Contestants (and admins) sign in with GitHub, so you need an OAuth app —
separate from the sync GitHub App above. OAuth apps have no manifest/create
API, so this is a guided flow rather than an auto-filled one:

```bash
# 1. Open GitHub's new-OAuth-App page for the event org and print the exact
#    field values to paste (callback = <EVENT_URL>/api/auth/callback/github).
ctf-setup.sh oauth-app
#    In the browser: fill the printed fields, Register, then "Generate a new
#    client secret" and copy the Client ID + secret.

# 2. Wire them into .env. The secret is read from a hidden prompt — never on
#    the command line or in shell history.
ctf-setup.sh oauth-config --client-id <client id>
```

This sets `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`; the app
reads them at runtime. `EVENT_URL` in `.env` is **the** event URL — Caddy, the app's
auth flow, the HTTPS start-up guard, the CSRF origin check and the leaderboard
link in every fork's score comment all read it, and nothing else carries a
second copy. The deleted config file used to carry a `url:` field beside it;
it was a deployment fact living in an event file, it disagreed silently, and
it is gone ([ADR 43](decisions.md#adr-43-one-url-and-it-lives-in-env-not-eventyaml)).
You can also set both by hand instead of using the helpers, and you may
register the OAuth app on your personal account rather than the org.

> **Use HTTPS for any real event.** Set `EVENT_URL` to `https://<your-domain>`
> (not `http://`) for anything beyond local testing. Caddy auto-provisions TLS
> for a real domain, and the sign-in session cookie is only marked `Secure`
> when the URL is HTTPS — over plain `http://` the session cookie can be sniffed

## Configuration

**There is no configuration file.** Since #386 an event is configured in
exactly two places, and the split between them is the whole design: what a box
needs before it can answer its first request lives in `.env`, and everything
an organizer changes while the event runs lives in Redis behind `/admin`.

| Plane | Where | Who writes it | What lives there |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap** — facts the containers need at start | `.env` | the wizard, or you, once per deployment | `GITHUB_ORG`, `ADMIN_LOGINS`, `SCORE_IMAGE`, `EVENT_URL`, and the secrets |
| **Runtime** — everything an organizer tunes during the event | the `ctf:admin:settings` hash in Redis | `/admin`, live | which modules run, which Secure Development targets run, the event's identity, the scoring schedule, freeze, hint policy, team caps |

Bootstrap keys are read at container **start**, not at build: changing one is
an `.env` edit plus a restart, never a rebuild. Runtime settings are read on
every request and take effect immediately, with no restart at all. See
[ADR 55](decisions.md#adr-55-configuration-v2-env-bootstrap-admin-runtime-no-eventyaml)
for why the old baked config file was retired.

### The four bootstrap keys

Everything else in `.env` is a secret or a transport detail (see
[Environment variables](#environment-variables) for the complete list). These
four are the event's identity to the machine:

| Key | Required | What it drives | Empty or unset means |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ADMIN_LOGINS` | **yes** | Comma-separated GitHub logins (matched case-insensitively) allowed into `/admin`. Read by `lib/bootstrap-env.ts` at start. | **Nobody is an admin** — `/admin` 403s every login, including yours. This fails CLOSED on purpose; there is no "no allowlist, let everyone in" state. |
| `GITHUB_ORG` | when running Secure Development | The event org contestants fork the target repos under. Drives every fork link the app renders, the policy-page prose, and the repos `sync` polls. | The app renders a plain repo name instead of a broken link, and `sync` refuses to start at all, logging `ctf-sync: GITHUB_ORG is not set`. |
| `SCORE_IMAGE` | when running Secure Development | Your scorer image, built from `scorer/` and pushed somewhere the box and the forks can pull it. | The event does not run Secure Development — see below. |
| `EVENT_URL` | **yes** | **The** event URL: Caddy's TLS host, the auth callback origin, the HTTPS start-up guard, the CSRF origin check, and the leaderboard link in every score comment ([ADR 43](decisions.md#adr-43-one-url-and-it-lives-in-env-not-eventyaml)). | Defaults to `http://localhost`, which is fine only for a local trial. |

**`SCORE_IMAGE` is how a box says whether it runs Secure Development.** It is
not just "which image to pull": it is the one setup-time fact left about that
module, and three things read it as the answer.

1. **The compose profile.** `scripts/dev-stack` and Fly's
   `deploy/fly/render-compose.sh` add `--profile secdev` **iff `SCORE_IMAGE`
   is non-empty** — the one place the question is answered at `up` time, and
   derived rather than a second knob to drift (the lesson of #372/#374).
2. **The default module set.** On a first boot against an empty Redis — and as
   the fail-open answer when the settings read fails — a box with
   `SCORE_IMAGE` set enables `secure-development` and nothing else; a box
   without it enables nothing, and the landing page renders its explicit
   no-boards state pointing at `/admin`.
3. **The admin toggle.** With `SCORE_IMAGE` empty, `/admin`'s Secure
   Development switch is disabled with that reason named — there would be no
   scorer container for it to talk to.

`ctf-setup.sh` reads it the same way: with no `SCORE_IMAGE` it skips every
fork, mirror and poll step instead of failing.

### What `/admin` owns

Everything below is a runtime setting in `ctf:admin:settings`, changed from the
panel while the event is running, and covered in
[docs/operations.md](operations.md#organizer-admin-panel):

- **Which modules run** — Event → Modules. Quiz, Classic and AI are switched on
  and off live; so is Secure Development, whenever `SCORE_IMAGE` is set.
- **Which Secure Development targets run** — Secure Development → Targets. The
  setup script forks and provisions all six; the panel picks the live subset,
  and `sync` re-reads it every tick.
- **The event's identity** — Event → Identity: name (default `OWASP CTF`),
  tagline, location, contact e-mail, Discord invite.
- **The scoring schedule and the freeze** — Event → Schedule: scoring opens,
  scoring closes, and the manual pause.
- **Hints, teams and caps** — the hint switch and prices, the registration
  window, and players per team.
- **Module content** — quiz questions, classic challenges and flags, AI
  challenges: all authored in the panel, all exportable through the event
  archive.

None of it needs a restart, a rebuild, or an edit on the box.

### Modules: registration is code, enablement is runtime

Four module ids are registered today — `secure-development`, `quiz`, `classic`
and `ai`. **Registration is deliberately static** (ADR 35): a module id exists
because the kit ships code for it — `apps/web/src/lib/modules.ts`'s `ModuleId`
union and its registry are the whole list. There is no config-file namespace to
add one to and no dynamic discovery; see
[docs/modules.md](modules.md) for what a new module has to provide.

**Enablement is entirely runtime.** Every `app` image ships the routes, nav
entries and admin tabs for all four, so switching one on in `/admin` → Event →
Modules takes effect on the next request, and switching it off hides it the
same way. Nothing about which modules run is decided at build time any more,
and nothing about it is decided in `.env` — except that `SCORE_IMAGE` decides
whether Secure Development *can* be switched on at all, because that module is
the only one with containers of its own.

Enabling a module changes the **landing page**, not just the nav: the
platform frame (event name, dates, countdown, CTAs, Discord link, progress
card) stays the same, but each enabled module contributes its own tagline,
hero paragraph, "what to expect" section and steps, so the home page always
describes exactly the modules an event actually runs — a quiz-only event
never advertises forking a target or opening a PR. See
[docs/modules.md §5](modules.md#section-5-ui--presentation-contract) for the `home`
block contract.

**`secure-development` is not required — a single module is enough to run an
event.** `ctf-setup.sh`'s `org`/`render`/`doctor` each skip fork-based
provisioning and report "nothing to provision/check" instead of failing when
no `SCORE_IMAGE` is set, and `sync` is simply never started. A quiz-only event
is therefore a supported event on its own: `/challenges` 404s (that route
doesn't exist without the module that owns it), and `/how-to-play`, `/rules`,
the landing page, the leaderboard, and `/profile` all compose from whatever
modules *are* enabled instead of assuming `secure-development` is one of
them. See [docs/modules.md §5](modules.md#section-5-ui--presentation-contract) for
the UI composition contract and [ADR 55](decisions.md#adr-55-configuration-v2-env-bootstrap-admin-runtime-no-eventyaml)
for where module registration and enablement live now — the app's registry and
the `/admin` settings, with `SCORE_IMAGE` as the one switch Secure Development
answers to. [ADR 24](decisions.md#adr-24-tolerating-a-missing-module-vs-rejecting-an-unknown-one)
records why an unconfigured module is tolerated while an unknown one is not.

**Boot a quiz-only event with `docker compose --profile app up -d --build`**
— just the `app` profile, and no build-args at all. Secure Development's
profiles (`secdev` / `push`) carry that module's two services, `sync` and the
`scorer`, and a quiz-only event has no use for either: nothing to poll, and no scorer image to pull
(the compose fallback is the maintainers' private image, so asking for it
fails the bring-up). See the [profiles table](#which-profiles-do-i-need)
above.

If you do pass `--profile secdev` anyway — say you enabled
`secure-development` mid-event and then dropped it again — `sync` polls the
org in `.env`, or refuses to start at all if `GITHUB_ORG` is empty, logging
`ctf-sync: GITHUB_ORG is not set` and exiting non-zero
(`sync/src/index.js`'s `main()`); `docker-compose.yml`'s `sync` service is
`restart: on-failure`, so that refusal repeats in the log until the key is
set. You still need a `SCORE_IMAGE` for the scorer that profile also brings
up.

### Hints and teams have no bootstrap knob

Neither is an `.env` key: team size is the `/admin` Event tab's "players per
team" knob, and **hints have exactly one switch: `/admin`'s hint controls**, a
runtime override stored in Redis (ADR 31). It is live, survives restarts,
and governs everything — whether a hint can be bought, whether the challenges
page offers the button, and whether the leaderboard shows hint penalties. There
is no environment variable and no rebuild involved; see
[docs/operations.md](operations.md#organizer-admin-panel).

The one thing an organizer setting cannot do is turn hints on without
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_*` credentials — hint text lives only in Upstash, so
without them there is nothing to reveal. What a
module must provide to
plug in — scoring contract, transports, security requirements,
provisioning — is documented in [docs/modules.md](modules.md).

### Changing a setting after the stack is running

| What you changed | What it takes |
|---|---|
| Anything in `/admin` — modules, targets, identity, schedule, hints, teams, content | Nothing. It is live on the next request. |
| `ADMIN_LOGINS`, `GITHUB_ORG`, `EVENT_URL`, a secret | Edit `.env`, then bring the stack back up to recreate the containers with the new environment — `docker compose --profile secdev --profile app up -d` with a `SCORE_IMAGE` set, `docker compose --profile app up -d` without one. No rebuild either way. |
| `SCORE_IMAGE` (adding or dropping Secure Development's containers) | Edit `.env`, then bring the stack up with — or without — `--profile secdev`. |
| The app's own code (a kit upgrade) | `docker compose --profile app build app`, then `up -d`. |

The contestant app (`apps/web/`, vendored — see
[`apps/web/VENDORED.md`](https://github.com/dcotelo/owasp-ctf/blob/main/apps/web/VENDORED.md))
reads **no build-time configuration at all**, and no image in the kit takes a
config build-arg. That is the point of #386: an image is the same image on
every box, and a build that forgot a variable can no longer ship an event with
an empty admin list. Dates come from the scoring schedule (**Scoring opens** /
**Scoring closes**) set in `/admin` → Event, same as name, tagline, location,
contact e-mail and Discord invite — all runtime settings, read on every
request.

### Environment variables

`.env` is what `docker-compose.yml` interpolates; each service then reads its
own environment. A variable reaches a container **only if `docker-compose.yml`
passes it** — setting one that compose does not forward does nothing, silently
(that is why `ALLOW_INSECURE_EVENT_URL` and the gate pair are wired through
explicitly). Rows marked *override* are knobs compose does not forward; reach
them with a `docker-compose.override.yml`, or on Fly through `.env.fly`. Rows
marked *fixed* are values compose sets itself and you do not set at all.

`setup/ctf-setup.sh secrets` generates the required ones (`.env.example` is
the same list, annotated), and `doctor` flags a missing `REDIS_PASSWORD`.

**Compose bring-up** — read by compose at `up`, before any service starts:

| Variable | Read by | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | `redis`, `srh` | **required** (`:?`) | Redis `requirepass`. Unset *or empty* fails `up` at interpolation rather than starting an open Redis; only `srh` can reach `redis:6379`. |
| `SRH_TOKEN` | `srh`; `app`/`scorer`/`sync` as `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | required | Bearer token in front of the Redis REST proxy every service talks to. |
| `SCORE_INGEST` | compose (Caddyfile choice) | `poll` | `poll` or `push`: mounts `caddy/Caddyfile.<mode>`. Must match the `--profile` you pass. |
| `SCORE_IMAGE` | `scorer` image; `scripts/dev-stack` and `deploy/fly/render-compose.sh` as the `secdev` switch | `ghcr.io/owasp-ctf/score:latest` (private) | Your scorer image built from `scorer/`. Non-empty is what makes Secure Development *available*: it adds the `secdev` profile, seeds the first-boot default module set, and permits the `/admin` toggle (`enabledModules` still decides what is live). Empty and `ctf-setup org` skips every fork/mirror/poll step instead of failing; non-empty and it provisions all six targets. |
| `EVENT_URL` | `caddy` as `EVENT_HOST`; `app` as `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | `http://localhost` | **The** event URL — TLS host, auth callback origin, HTTPS start-up guard, CSRF origin check. `https://` for any real event. |
| `REDIS_DIR` | `redis` | `/data` | Where the append-only file lives inside the volume. Fly sets `/data/redis` (one volume per machine, see [docs/fly.md](fly.md)). |
| `STATE_PATH` | `sync` | `/state/state.json` | The poller's cursor file. Fly sets `/data/sync/state.json`. |
| `EVENT_HOST`, `SRH_MODE`, `REDISCLI_AUTH` | `caddy`, `srh`, `redis` | *fixed* | Derived by compose: Caddy's host from `EVENT_URL`, `srh`'s config mode (`env`), `redis-cli`'s password from `REDIS_PASSWORD` so `docker compose exec redis redis-cli` authenticates itself. |

**App** (`apps/web`, runtime unless noted):

| Variable | Read by | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | `lib/auth.ts`, `lib/gate.ts` | required | Session-signing secret; also keys the pre-event gate cookie's HMAC. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | `lib/auth.ts` | required | The sign-in OAuth app (not the poll GitHub App). |
| `ALLOW_INSECURE_EVENT_URL` | `instrumentation.ts` | unset | `1` downgrades the `http://` non-loopback refusal to a start-up warning. TLS-less closed networks only. |
| `CHALLENGES_GATE_ENABLED`, `CHALLENGES_GATE_PASSWORD` | `lib/gate.ts` | unset | Pre-event shared-password gate over the module pages: `true` plus a password. A half-configured gate stays *open*. |
| `DEMO_MODE` | `/admin` page, `/api/admin/seed` | unset | `1` exposes the "Seed demo data" button and route. `scripts/dev-stack` sets it; never in a real event. |
| `LEADERBOARD_SOURCE` | `lib/leaderboard/source.ts` | *fixed*: `lambda` | `mock` / `lambda` / `upstash`. With `secure-development` disabled the mode is forced to `empty` (no scorer read; the board is built from the module overlays alone); an unknown value falls back to `mock` with a warning. |
| `LEADERBOARD_API_URL` | `lib/challenges.ts`, `lib/leaderboard/lambda.ts` | *fixed*: `http://scorer:4000` | Scorer base URL for the challenge catalogue and the board. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | `lib/upstash.ts`; also `scorer/src/store.js`, `sync/src/redis.js` | *fixed*: `http://srh:80`, `SRH_TOKEN` | Redis-over-REST endpoint. Hints, teams, admin settings and module content live behind it. |
| `TEAM_WRITES_ENABLED` | `lib/team-store.ts` | *fixed*: `"true"` | Enables team create/join writes; off in mock mode. |
| `GITHUB_ORG` | `lib/bootstrap-env.ts` | empty | The GitHub org contestants fork the target repos under; drives fork links and policy-page prose. Empty renders plain repo-name text, never a broken link. |
| `ADMIN_LOGINS` | `lib/bootstrap-env.ts`, `lib/admin-auth.ts` | empty | Comma-separated GitHub logins (case-insensitive) allowed into `/admin`. Empty means nobody; changing it needs an env edit and a restart. |

**Sync** (`sync/src/config.js`, poll mode only):

| Variable | Read by | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_ORG` | `sync` | required | The event org whose forked target repos are polled. `sync` refuses to start without it, logging `ctf-sync: GITHUB_ORG is not set` — for the poller a missing org is a misconfiguration, not "nothing to poll". Which targets inside the org are polled is a runtime `/admin` setting `sync` re-reads every tick. |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | `sync` | required | The poll GitHub App; the key is base64-encoded PEM. `sync` refuses to start without both. |
| `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` | `sync` | auto-discovered | Pin the installation when the App has more than one. |
| `SCORER_TOKEN` | `sync`; `scorer` as `CTF_SCORE_BEARER_TOKEN` | required | Bearer token `sync` presents to `POST /score`. |
| `SCORER_URL` | `sync` | *fixed*: `http://scorer:4000` | Where scores are submitted. |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `sync` | `30000` | *override*. Integer in `1..1789569705` (`floor((2^31-1)/1.2)`, headroom for the +20% jitter); anything else refuses at boot rather than tight-looping. |
| `GITHUB_API_URL` | `sync` | `https://api.github.com` | *override*. `scripts/smoke.sh` points it at `mock-github`. |
| `COMMENT_AUTHOR` | `sync` | `github-actions[bot]` | *override*. The only login whose `<!-- ctf-score -->` markers are ingested as points. |

**Scorer, `score serve`** (`scorer/src/serve.js`, on the box):

| Variable | Read by | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CTF_SCORE_BEARER_TOKEN` | `serve.js` | *fixed*: `SCORER_TOKEN` | Bearer auth on `POST /score`; falls back to `SCORER_TOKEN`, refuses to start with neither. |
| `PORT` | `serve.js` | `4000` | *override*. Checked lexically, integer `0..65535`; a malformed value refuses rather than binding an ephemeral port. |
| `RUBRIC_DIR` | `rubric.js` (serve and judge) | `/rubric` (image build arg `RUBRIC_DIR=rubric.owasp`) | The rubric baked into the image — see [docs/scorer.md](scorer.md). |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | `serve.js`, `store.js` | *fixed*: `http://srh:80` | Redis store when set, in-memory store when unset. |

**Scorer, `score judge`** (`scorer/src/judge.js`, `exec.js`) — runs inside the
fork's Action, so these come from the rendered `ctf-score.yml`, org Actions
secrets/variables, or `scripts/acceptance-scorer.sh`, never from `.env`:

| Variable | Read by | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CTF_OUT_DIR` | `judge.js`, `entrypoint.sh` | `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` | Where `ctf-score.md` is written. The workflow sets `/ctf-out`, **outside the PR checkout** — the marker in it is trust-authoritative. |
| `SCORE_API`, `SCORE_TOKEN` | `judge.js` | unset (poll mode) | Push mode: `POST <SCORE_API>/score` with the bearer. Fed from the org secrets `LEADERBOARD_URL` / `LEADERBOARD_TOKEN`; `SCORE_TOKEN` is required whenever `SCORE_API` is set. |
| `CTF_DISCLOSE_TABLE` | `judge.js` | disclose | `0` / `false` / `no` hides the per-challenge table in the PR comment (progress bar and counts always show). An org Actions *variable*. |
| `APP_READY_TRIES`, `APP_READY_DELAY` | `judge.js` | `60`, `5` (seconds) | Readiness probe before judging. A literal `0` skips it — only a bring-up script that already proved the app up should set that (`securityshepherd.sh` does). |
| `CTF_SCORE_SAFETY_MS` | `exec.js` | `30000` | Per-probe kill timeout, ms; values below 1 fall back to the default. |
| `CTF_SCORE_CONCURRENCY` | `exec.js` | per-target default | Overrides the probe pool width (clamped to `1..itemCount`). |
| `CTF_UPSTREAM_DIR` | `judge.js` | `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` | Source tree for the static probes that read the contestant's code instead of HTTP. |

**Target bring-up scripts** (`scorer/entrypoints/*.sh`, sourced by the judge's
`entrypoint.sh`; `TARGET` and `APP_URL` are the required inputs, set by the
workflow):

| Variable | Read by | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WEBGOAT_JDK_IMAGE` | `webgoat.sh` | `eclipse-temurin:23-jdk-noble` | JDK used to build a fork from source through its own `./mvnw`. |
| `SS_UPSTREAM_REPO`, `SS_UPSTREAM_REF` | `securityshepherd.sh` | `OWASP/SecurityShepherd` @ `662771b…` | Source cloned when the workspace has none. Pinned to a commit, never a branch. |
| `WEBWOLF_URL`, `WEBGOAT_LEAKED_ADMIN_PW`, `WEBGOAT_DESER_PAYLOAD` | exported by `webgoat.sh`, read by the WebGoat rubric's tests | *computed* | Not inputs: the bring-up derives them from the running container and always exports them (an *empty* payload means "patched", an *absent* one would fail two challenges outright). |
| `<TARGET>_UPSTREAM_REPO`, `<TARGET>_UPSTREAM_REF` | `scripts/acceptance-patched.sh` (`JS_`, `DVWA_`, `WEBGOAT_`, `VULNERABLEAPP_`, `VAMPI_`, `SS_`), `scripts/acceptance-target.sh` (`WG_`) | pinned per script | Local acceptance only: which fork and ref to judge as the patched or stock baseline. |
