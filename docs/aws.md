# Deploy on AWS (ECS Fargate, Terraform)

The kit runs on AWS as a **managed stack**: the app, the Upstash-REST shim and
the secure-development services on **Fargate**, behind an **ALB** with an ACM
certificate, over **ElastiCache for Redis**. `terraform apply` up, `terraform
destroy` down — still the single-shot lifecycle for an ephemeral event, with no
instance to patch.

The module lives at
[`deploy/aws-terraform/`](https://github.com/dcotelo/ctf-in-a-box/tree/main/deploy/aws-terraform);
this page is the walkthrough. It stands up the **runtime** control plane only —
provisioning the GitHub org is a separate one-time step (below).

**This replaced a single EC2 instance running docker-compose.** If you deployed
the earlier module, the upgrade is a move rather than an `apply`: see
[the migration steps](https://github.com/dcotelo/ctf-in-a-box/tree/main/deploy/aws-terraform#migrating-from-the-ec2-box).

## Why ECS now, when one EC2 box was the point

The old module's argument was real and is worth stating before dismantling it:
compose on one host needed no translation to task definitions, poll mode needed
no inbound for scoring, and a replaced box repopulated its leaderboard from the
GitHub PR comments.

What changed the answer is **where the event's data lives**. On the box, Redis
was a container writing an append-only file to an EBS volume: durability was
yours to get right, and a lost volume or a bad fsync was a lost event. That is
the wrong thing to hand-roll for a day people have blocked out. ElastiCache
makes it AWS's problem — snapshots, replication, automatic failover across two
AZs — and once Redis is managed the rest follows almost for free: the ALB gives
native health checks and a task swap without dropping the event, and Fargate
removes the instance.

Two things did **not** change:

- **`srh` stays.** The app, scorer and sync speak only the Upstash REST API and
  never raw Redis, so ElastiCache changed exactly one thing — what `srh`
  connects *to*. Everything above it is the same code as compose.
- **The isolation is still in the security groups.** ADR 41 put the boundary
  there rather than in the network topology, and it stays: only the ALB reaches
  the app, only the app and workers reach `srh`, and only `srh` reaches
  ElastiCache. The app has no route to Redis at all.

What it costs is the honest tradeoff, and the module README
[itemises it](https://github.com/dcotelo/ctf-in-a-box/tree/main/deploy/aws-terraform#what-it-costs):
roughly four times the EC2 box at the defaults. Two variables bring it down if
that is too much.

## Prerequisites (once, off the stack)

1. **Provision the org** from your laptop: `./setup/ctf-setup.sh org` (uses your
   `gh` auth + local `docker login ghcr.io`). See the
   [Quickstart](hosting.md#quickstart-zero-to-a-scored-event).
2. **Pick the domain first**, then create the GitHub apps with the OAuth
   callback at `https://<domain>/api/auth/callback/github` (`ctf-setup.sh
   app-manifest`/`app-config` and `oauth-app`/`oauth-config`).
3. **Store the secrets in SSM Parameter Store** as `SecureString`s under a path
   prefix (default `/ctf-in-a-box`). Task definitions reference them by
   `valueFrom`, so no secret is ever a plaintext environment variable. The
   `aws ssm put-parameter` list is in the module
   [README](https://github.com/dcotelo/ctf-in-a-box/tree/main/deploy/aws-terraform#prerequisites-done-once-off-the-stack).

## Deploy

ECR does not exist until the first apply, so the image cannot be named on the
first pass. Three steps, once:

```sh
cd deploy/aws-terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars    # edit: domain, event_yaml_b64
terraform init
terraform apply -target=aws_ecr_repository.main # just the registry
./deploy.sh                                     # build with event.yaml baked in, push
terraform apply                                 # the rest of the stack
```

Afterwards a redeploy is one command:

```sh
./deploy.sh --apply
```

Terraform creates the VPC (two AZs; a public tier for the ALB and tasks, a
private tier for ElastiCache alone), the five security groups above, the
ElastiCache replication group with in-transit encryption and an AUTH token it
generates for you, the ALB with its ACM certificate, the ECR repository, and the
Fargate services for whichever modules this event runs — a quiz-only event
brings up no scorer and no poller, the same rule as the compose profiles.

**`deploy.sh` owns the config bake, and Terraform cannot.** The app image bakes
`event.yaml` at build time through `EVENT_CONFIG_B64`; an image built without it
ships an empty `admins` list, so `/admin` 403s for everyone and the branding
goes generic. On the EC2 box that bake happened on the instance at bring-up; ECS
pulls a prebuilt image, so it becomes a step of the deploy.

The tag is content-addressed — revision plus a hash of the config — and ECR is
set to immutable tags, so re-running with nothing changed reports "already
there" and skips the build instead of failing. `./deploy.sh --dry-run` prints
every command and runs none of them.

Watch a rollout:

```sh
aws ecs describe-services --cluster <cluster_name> --services app
aws logs tail /ecs/<name>/app --follow
```

Both names come from the `terraform output`.

## Tear down

```sh
terraform destroy
```

## Notes

- **Which build is live?** `GET https://<domain>/health` returns the running
  revision and build time. That is also what the ALB health-checks — liveness
  only, no Redis, deliberately. A probe that read Redis would deregister every
  app task during a blip, and replacing tasks cannot fix Redis; the app's own
  reads fail open for the same reason.
- **HTTPS is not optional.** The session cookie is `Secure`, so `domain` is a
  required variable and there is no working HTTP mode to fall back to.
- **Terraform state now holds a secret.** The old module could honestly say it
  did not; this one generates the ElastiCache AUTH token, and a generated
  password is in state by construction. Use an encrypted remote backend with
  restricted access.
- **Durability is snapshots, not AOF** — daily, five retained by default. A
  restore loses up to a day rather than up to a second. For the authored content
  (questions, challenges, flags, hints) the app's own event archive export is
  finer-grained and portable, and is the backup that matters for re-running an
  event.
- **Everything is tagged** (`Project` / `ManagedBy` / `Event`, extend with
  `var.tags`) so the event's resources are easy to filter and tear down.
- **DNS in another account** (the stack in a throwaway account, the zone in your
  main one): leave `route53_zone_id` empty, set `acm_certificate_arn` to a
  certificate in the stack's region, and point your own record at the
  `alb_dns_name` output. Terraform manages the record only when the zone is in
  the same account.
- **Changes to the module are CI-validated, never applied** —
  `.github/workflows/terraform.yml` runs `terraform fmt -check`, `validate` and
  `test` on any change under `deploy/aws-terraform/`. `terraform test` is the
  one that reads **rendered** output: `validate` never looks at it, which is how
  a fundamentally broken bring-up script survived in the EC2 version unnoticed.
  The tests render the container definitions at plan time behind
  `mock_provider` — no AWS credentials, no network — and assert that only `srh`
  may reach ElastiCache, that the cache connection is `rediss://`, that no
  secret is baked in as plaintext, and that scorer and sync appear only for the
  modules the event runs. `deploy.sh` has its own bats suite for the half
  Terraform cannot see.
- Kubernetes is tracked separately (Helm chart,
  [issue #54](https://github.com/dcotelo/ctf-in-a-box/issues/54)).
