# Troubleshooting

For the organizer mid-event, ordered by the symptom you actually see —
diagnosis, then fix. Setting up for the first time? That's
[hosting.md](hosting.md). Verifying before the event? The checks in
[operations.md](operations.md#verifying-it-works) and the
[security checklist](security-checklist.md) catch most of this page before it
happens.

The two commands this page leans on:

```sh
docker compose logs -f sync            # the poller's own account of itself
docker compose exec redis redis-cli HGETALL ctf:admin:settings   # the live overrides
```

(`redis-cli` authenticates itself inside the container via `REDISCLI_AUTH` —
no password on the command line.)

## `docker compose up` refuses to start: "set REDIS_PASSWORD in .env"

**Symptom.** Compose exits immediately at interpolation with that message.

**Diagnosis.** Deliberate. Redis runs with `requirepass`, and compose reads
the variable with `:?` so a missing or empty value fails the bring-up
instead of quietly starting an unauthenticated Redis.

**Fix.** Add `REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 24)` to `.env` (a `.env`
from before the kit required it is the common case), or run
`./setup/ctf-setup.sh secrets` on a fresh checkout. Note the same
interpolation failure inside a script that pipes compose's stderr to
`/dev/null` looks like an empty service list, not an error.

## `/admin` 403s for every admin, or the site shows generic branding

**Symptom.** The event name is the stock "OWASP CTF" instead of yours, and nobody —
including you — can open `/admin`.

**Diagnosis.** The app image was built without `EVENT_CONFIG_B64`.
`event.yaml` is baked at **build** time; building without the arg silently
yields neutral defaults, including an **empty admins list**.

**Fix.** Rebuild with the arg and recreate:

```sh
EVENT_CONFIG_B64="$(base64 < event.yaml | tr -d '\n')" \
  docker compose --profile poll --profile app up -d --build
```

(Quiz/classic-only events: `--profile app` alone.) `scripts/dev-stack` and
the wizard both do this for you; a bare `docker compose build app` does not.

## A scored PR isn't landing on the leaderboard (poll mode)

Work down this list — each item is a different subsystem:

1. **Is the event frozen or outside the scoring window?** Check the Event tab
   (or `HGETALL ctf:admin:settings` — `paused`, `scoringStartsAt/EndsAt`). A
   freeze **holds** ingestion; the score is queued in the PR comment and
   ingests on the first tick after you unfreeze. Nothing is lost.
2. **Did the fork's Action run and post the score comment?** Open the PR: you
   should see the `github-actions[bot]` comment with the score table. No
   comment → the fork's workflow didn't run or failed; check the fork's
   Actions tab, then `./setup/ctf-setup.sh doctor` for the fork's
   provisioning row (workflow present? version current? image grant
   observed?). `upgrade` re-applies a stale workflow.
3. **Is `sync` actually polling?** `docker compose logs -f sync`. A clean
   `no polled module enabled, nothing to do` + exit 0 means your
   `event.yaml` has no `secure-development` module — that's correct for a
   quiz/classic-only event, and wrong if you expected scoring. A tick log
   with `dropped` counts names why a comment was refused (forged author,
   unknown target, malformed marker).
4. **Is the score comment authored by `github-actions[bot]`?** Only that
   author is trusted — a comment posted any other way (including by you) is
   dropped by design.
5. **Poll cadence is ~30 s** — a score that lands a minute late in a busy
   tick is normal, not stuck.

## The fork's Action fails: "no matching manifest for linux/amd64"

**Diagnosis.** The scorer image was built on Apple Silicon without a
platform pin — GitHub's runners are amd64.

**Fix.** Rebuild pinned and push:
`docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t <SCORE_IMAGE> --push scorer/`
(the wizard's own build step already pins this).

## Services log `NOAUTH Authentication required`

**Symptom.** `srh` (or anything behind it) errors with `NOAUTH`; reads and
writes fail.

**Diagnosis.** The password the running containers carry doesn't match the
Redis they're talking to — typically `.env` was edited after the stack came
up (compose does not re-read `.env` into running containers).

**Fix.** `docker compose up -d` again (recreates with current env). Note an
unauthenticated `PING` answering `NOAUTH` is the *correct* state —
`scripts/smoke.sh` asserts it — the bug is only when the kit's own services
hit it.

## `sync` is crash-looping (or ingestion died mid-event)

**Symptom.** `docker compose ps` shows `sync` restarting; every tick throws.

**Diagnosis.** Poll mode's cursor lives in `/state/state.json` on the
`sync-state` volume. Current `sync` validates and **repairs** a damaged
state file field by field (each repair is logged — look for repair lines
before assuming worse). Historically a bare `{}` — valid JSON, unusable
shape — crash-looped the poller for a whole event, which is exactly why the
repair exists.

**Fix.** Read the first error line of `docker compose logs sync`. If state
is beyond repair on an old version: `docker compose down && docker volume rm
<project>_sync-state && docker compose --profile poll --profile app up -d` —
losing the cursor is safe; poll mode re-reads scores from the PR comments
and the scorer's writes are idempotent on replay.

## A re-scored PR never updates ("it scored once and never again")

**Diagnosis.** The scoring workflow posts **one comment per target and
edits it** (placeholder → result). Current `sync` keys its seen-cache on the
comment's id *and* `updated_at`, so edits re-present; an old checkout keyed
on id alone and permanently burned the comment's id on the placeholder.

**Fix.** Update the kit (the revision-keyed cache is the fix). Re-presenting
an already-counted revision is harmless — the scorer's writes are monotonic.

## A service can't reach another: nothing but `fetch failed`

**Diagnosis.** Every service in `docker-compose.yml` names its network
(`frontend`/`backend`). A service added in an **override file** with no
`networks:` key joins compose's `default` network — a third network nothing
else is on — so DNS for it resolves nowhere. This exact trap once broke the
smoke stack's mock service.

**Fix.** Give the override service an explicit `networks: [frontend]` (or
`backend`, per its role).

## The app returns 500 on every request after start

**Symptom.** Logs say it is refusing to serve because `EVENT_URL` is
`http://` on a non-loopback host.

**Diagnosis.** Deliberate: sessions are cookie-only and the cookie is only
`Secure` over HTTPS — serving a real event over HTTP makes every session
(an organizer's included) sniffable.

**Fix.** Set an `https://` `EVENT_URL` (Caddy provisions TLS). Only for a
deliberately TLS-less closed network: `ALLOW_INSECURE_EVENT_URL=1` in
`.env`, which downgrades the refusal to a warning that says exactly what
you gave up.

## Still stuck

`./setup/ctf-setup.sh doctor` (the org, fork by fork) ·
`./scripts/smoke.sh` (the whole poll pipeline against fixtures — proves the
kit, isolates your event config) · the sync heartbeat in Redis
(`HGETALL ctf:sync:status`: last poll, ingested/dropped counts, last error,
last drop reason).
