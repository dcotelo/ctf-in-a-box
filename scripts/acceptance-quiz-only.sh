#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Proves a QUIZ-ONLY event.yaml (modules: { quiz: {} }, no secure-development
# at all) runs a whole event end to end, with no scorer/poll pipeline behind
# it. This is the standalone-module composition promise (docs/modules.md):
# a single module must be enough to run an event alone.
#
# Asserts:
#   - the compose line-up docs/hosting.md tells a quiz-only organizer to run
#     (`--profile app`) contains no secure-development service — no scorer to
#     pull, no poller — while the scored line-up still contains both
#   - the app builds and comes up bound to a quiz-only config (remember
#     EVENT_CONFIG_B64 is a BUILD-time arg — omitting it silently yields
#     neutral defaults, so this script never calls `docker build` without it)
#   - /quiz serves and shows a seeded question BY NAME
#   - /challenges 404s (module contract §5.4 — the route must not exist, not
#     just disappear from the nav; apps/web already pins this at the unit
#     level in app/(site)/challenges/__tests__/page-quiz-only.test.tsx, this
#     proves it through the real built app)
#   - /leaderboard shows a seeded contestant's quiz points BY LOGIN. A
#     quiz-only event always resolves the leaderboard source to "empty"
#     (lib/leaderboard/source.ts — secure-development disabled means no
#     scorer/lambda/upstash backend is even consulted), so a row landing here
#     at all can ONLY come from the module-contribution overlay reading real
#     quiz totals — this is the one assertion a vacuous "app never came up"
#     failure cannot fake (see the file header of scripts/acceptance-app.sh
#     and AGENTS.md's stock-scores-zero note for the same trap).
#   - `sync` REFUSES to start with no `GITHUB_ORG` — it logs
#     `ctf-sync: GITHUB_ORG is not set` and exits non-zero, rather than
#     polling nothing in silence (sync/src/config.js + index.js's main()).
#     Config v2 (#386) retired the old "nothing to poll, exit 0" path: the
#     poller reads its whole config from the environment now, so an empty
#     org is a misconfiguration, not a quiz-only event
#
# Seeding: no OAuth app exists in CI, and the DEMO_MODE 'Seed demo data'
# button is admin-session-gated (apps/web/src/app/api/admin/seed/route.ts) —
# faking that session is out of scope and not something any script in this
# repo does (dev-stack's own comment: it "does not fake or bypass that
# boundary"). Every existing acceptance/smoke script that needs
# admin-controlled state writes it straight to the same Redis the app reads
# (scripts/smoke.sh does this for ctf:admin:settings) rather than driving the
# authenticated route, and this script follows that precedent for the quiz
# module's exact real schema (key names from lib/quiz-keys.ts, question shape
# from lib/quiz-store.ts's `Question` type) — the same keys/shapes
# admin-store.ts's real seedDemoData would write, just written directly so
# the read side (getQuizTotals/listQuestions, exercised through the real
# built app) is what's actually under test.
#
# App: built directly via `docker build` (like acceptance-app.sh) and run
# standalone on a private network alongside real redis + srh images (the
# same ones docker-compose.yml pins) — a quiz-only event never touches the
# scorer, so there is nothing compose-shaped to gain by bringing it up too.
#
# sync: brought up through the REAL docker-compose.yml via `docker compose`
# (overriding only `GITHUB_ORG` and the restart policy) specifically so the
# refusal below is the deployed service definition refusing, not a
# hand-rolled `docker run` this script could drift from.
