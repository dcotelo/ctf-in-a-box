# Patched-scores-right gate — the POSITIVE direction of scoring verification.
#
# Sibling to acceptance-target.sh. That script proves a STOCK app scores 0/N
# (no free points). This one proves the opposite end: a *correctly patched*
# contestant fork scores EXACTLY the patched challenge — its points equal the
# catalogue difficulty, and every other challenge still fails. Nothing else in
# the kit proves the positive direction, so a scorer that silently stopped
# awarding points for a real fix would pass every existing gate.
#
# Usage: scripts/acceptance-patched.sh <target> <challenge-id>
#   e.g. scripts/acceptance-patched.sh juice-shop challenge-1-password-hash-leak
#
# It stages a pinned SOURCE tree, applies patches/<target>/<challenge-id>.patch —
# a reference fix that closes ONE challenge's vulnerability in SOURCE — builds the
# fork from its own Dockerfile, runs the judge, and asserts the positive result.
#
# WHICH SOURCE. vampi stages the ORIGINAL upstream (erev0s/VAmPI) — that gate was
# authored first, against original upstream, and is left as-is. The other five
# targets stage their OWASP-CTF *fork* pinned by commit SHA: the fork's CTF base
# branch is the exact tree a contestant forks and patches, and the authoritative
# per-challenge fixes (extracted from the private rubric repo's solutions/) apply
# to it directly. Both origins are just "a pinned source tree with a root
# Dockerfile"; the per-target config below is the only thing that differs.
#
# THE ANTI-VACUOUS-ZERO DISCIPLINE. A patch that breaks the build or the app's
# boot ALSO stops the exploit, which would score the challenge "patched" for the
# wrong reason while the whole app is down. This gate refuses that outcome:
#   * The judge only writes ctf-score.md when the exec runner measured EVERY
#     challenge; if the app stops answering the run aborts and NO report is
#     written (see scorer/src/judge.js "run.aborted"). So a report existing at
#     all proves all N challenges ran and reported.
#   * We then assert exactly ONE ✅ and (N-1) ❌. A ❌ means that challenge's
#     exploit child ran and the exploit SUCCEEDED — i.e. the app is up and still
#     genuinely vulnerable there. "1/N with the others unreached" cannot pass:
#     unreached challenges abort the run and produce no report.
#   * We assert the ✅ is the challenge we patched and its points equal the
#     catalogue difficulty (parsed independently from the catalogue JSON).
#   * POSITIVE CONTROL. The other-N-fail check proves the app is live for every
#     challenge EXCEPT the patched one — so on its own it cannot tell "vuln
#     closed" from "endpoint broke" for the ✅ row itself (a challenge whose
#     exploit test only asserts the exploit is absent scores ✅ just as well if
#     the route 500s or is deleted). So after the ✅ we boot the freshly built
#     patched image standalone and probe the endpoint the patch touched: it must
#     still return 200 with valid data. A broken endpoint FAILS the gate here.
#     (securityshepherd is control-exempt — a 3-container Maven TLS stack cannot
#     be re-booted standalone; see its arm for the honest residual gap.)
