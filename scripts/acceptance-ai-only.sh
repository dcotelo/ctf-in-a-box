#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Proves an AI-ONLY event.yaml (modules: { ai: {} }, no secure-development at
# all) runs a whole event end to end, with no scorer/poll pipeline behind it.
# This is the standalone-module composition promise (docs/modules.md): a
# single module must be enough to run an event alone. Sibling of
# scripts/acceptance-quiz-only.sh and scripts/acceptance-classic-only.sh —
# read classic's header first; this one follows every one of its design
# decisions for the ai module instead, plus one check neither sibling has
# (the launch-key endpoint, below).
#
# Asserts:
#   - the compose line-up docs/hosting.md tells an ai-only organizer to run
#     (`--profile app`) contains no secure-development service — no scorer to
#     pull, no poller — while the scored line-up still contains both
#   - the app builds and comes up bound to an ai-only config (remember
#     EVENT_CONFIG_B64 is a BUILD-time arg — omitting it silently yields
#     neutral defaults, so this script never calls `docker build` without it)
#   - /ai serves and shows a seeded challenge BY TITLE
#   - /ai/<id> 200s for that challenge, and /ai/<bad-id> 404s (issue #209's
#     dual-cause not-found — an unknown id must 404 same as a disabled module)
#   - /challenges, /flags and /quiz all 404 (module contract §5.4 — those
#     routes must not exist, not just disappear from the nav; an ai-only
#     event never enables classic, quiz or secure-development)
#   - /leaderboard shows a seeded contestant's ai points BY LOGIN. An ai-only
#     event always resolves the leaderboard source to "empty"
#     (lib/leaderboard/source.ts — secure-development disabled means no
#     scorer/lambda/upstash backend is even consulted), so a row landing here
#     at all can ONLY come from the module-contribution overlay reading real
#     ai totals — this is the one assertion a vacuous "app never came up"
#     failure cannot fake (see acceptance-classic-only.sh's identical note,
#     and AGENTS.md's stock-scores-zero note for the same trap).
#   - `GET /api/ai/launch-key` 200s with `"alg":"Ed25519"` and a PEM-encoded
#     public key in the body. THE ai-specific check no sibling module has: an
#     external integrator has to verify a launch token against this endpoint
#     with no OAuth, no cookie and no admin session available to it at all
#     (ADR 53) — this proves the public identity endpoint mints its keypair
#     lazily and serves it correctly on a cold box, not just that some route
#     under it returns 200.
#   - `sync` exits 0 and STAYS exited rather than crash/restart-looping with
#     nothing to poll (sync/src/config.js + index.js's main(), and
#     docker-compose.yml's sync `restart: on-failure`)
#
# Seeding: no OAuth app exists in CI, and the DEMO_MODE 'Seed demo data'
# button is admin-session-gated (apps/web/src/app/api/admin/seed/route.ts) —
# faking that session is out of scope and not something any script in this
# repo does. This script writes the ai module's real Redis schema directly,
# the same precedent acceptance-quiz-only.sh and acceptance-classic-only.sh
# follow. Key names/builders come from apps/web/src/lib/ai-keys.ts, the public
# challenge shape is the `AiChallenge` type in apps/web/src/lib/ai-store.ts
# (id, title, category, description, points, order, mode, urlTemplate — never
# a flag, hint or signing key, which live in their own SECRET hashes), and the
# solve row shape (`{points, at, source}`) is the literal AWARD_SCRIPT writes
# in ai-store.ts.
#
# ai-store.ts documents SEVEN `ctf:ai:*` keys this script's assertions touch
# (plus two more it seeds for realism only):
#   - ctf:ai:challenges        hash, id -> JSON AiChallenge (read by /ai)
#   - ctf:ai:categories        string, JSON array of category names
#   - ctf:ai:flag              hash, id -> the flag AS AUTHORED (seeded for
#                               schema realism only — this script never
#                               submits a flag, so it is not independently
#                               asserted below)
#   - ctf:ai:flagnorm          hash, id -> flagComparisonForm(flag,
#                               caseSensitive) (same: realism only, not
#                               asserted — but this is the value grading
#                               actually compares against, never the authored
#                               flag, so it is seeded with the real comparison
#                               form rather than a copy of the authored one)
#   - ctf:ai:signkey           hash, id -> the challenge's event-signing key
#                               (realism only — this script never signs an
#                               event)
#   - ctf:ai:points            hash, login -> running points total (read by
#                               the leaderboard overlay's getAiTotals)
#   - ctf:ai:solved            hash, login -> running solve count (ditto)
#   - ctf:ai:solvecount        hash, id -> distinct-solver count (seeded for
#                               realism only — /ai renders it per challenge
#                               but this script does not assert on it)
#   - ctf:ai:solves:<login>    hash, id -> JSON {points, at, source} (seeded
#                               for realism — a real award always writes this
#                               alongside the two aggregate hashes — but not
#                               independently asserted here)
#
# Deliberately NOT seeded: ctf:ai:launchkey. That module-wide Ed25519 keypair
# is minted LAZILY on first use (getAiLaunchKeys in ai-store.ts) — writing one
# here would only prove a fixture round-trips, not that a cold box mints one
# correctly. The /api/ai/launch-key assertion below exercises exactly that
# lazy-mint path against a box that has never touched the key before.
#
# App: built directly via `docker build` (like acceptance-app.sh) and run
# standalone on a private network alongside real redis + srh images (the same
# ones docker-compose.yml pins) — an ai-only event never touches the scorer,
# so there is nothing compose-shaped to gain by bringing it up too.
#
# sync: brought up through the REAL docker-compose.yml via `docker compose`
# (with only its event.yaml volume mount overridden to this script's scratch
# config) specifically so the restart-policy assertion below is testing the
# actual deployed policy, not a policy this script guessed and could drift
