# scripts/lib/acceptance-lib.sh
# Shared machinery for the acceptance gates. Sourced, never executed.
#
# acceptance-target.sh proves the NEGATIVE direction (stock app scores 0/N);
# acceptance-patched.sh proves the POSITIVE direction (a correctly patched fork
# scores exactly the patched challenge). Both stage the same way, build the same
# scorer image, and run the same judge — the only differences are "apply a
# reference patch before the build" and "assert a different result". These
# functions are that common core, factored out so the positive gate reuses the
# negative gate's proven staging/build/judge path instead of reimplementing it.
#
# Portability: these run under bash on BSD (macOS) and GNU (Linux CI) userlands.
# No GNU-only sed/grep escapes.

# acc_url_for <target> — sets APP_SCHEME and APP_URL_SUFFIX for the target.
# This is the same per-target URL table acceptance-target.sh carries (see its
# header for why the suffix, not just a port, is per-target). Kept in lockstep
# with that table and setup/ctf-setup.sh's app_url_for(); a new target needs an
# entry in all three.
