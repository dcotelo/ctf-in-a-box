# Proves what a kit event.yaml still drives at BUILD time versus what is a
# runtime /admin setting now, on this branch. `github.org` is still baked in:
# the app's challenge fork links must follow it rather than a hardcoded
# OWASP-CTF (self-hosted contestants must fork the org the kit actually
# created, not the upstream canonical one). The event's name and which
# Secure Development targets run are BOTH runtime /admin settings now (issue
# #386) and are not baked at all, so a build with no Redis behind it must
# fail open to their spec defaults — the name, and all six targets — rather
# than render nothing, an error, or a name baked from this file.
#
# `modules.secure-development.targets` below is deliberately baked in and
# deliberately INERT (config v2 PR2, #386): which Secure Development targets
# run is an admin-panel setting read from Redis at request time, not a
# build-time one, and with no Redis behind this build every one of the six
# targets.tsv targets renders regardless of what this file says. This script
# pins that: DVWA and VAmPI (named in the config below) AND WebGoat (not
# named at all) all render — the config's `targets:` list is not read. The
# reverse — that the admin-chosen subset actually narrows what renders — is
# pinned by the /challenges page's own vitest suite, not here.
#
# ChallengeGrid (the /challenges app list) is a Client Component, but its
# server parent reads the live target list from Redis (`getEnabledApps`) and
# passes it down as props, so the route renders dynamically (`ƒ /challenges`
# in the build output, not `○`) and Next.js still emits the rendered app
# names into the server HTML response body on every request — no need to
# fall back to grepping the flight/__NEXT_DATA__ payload separately.
